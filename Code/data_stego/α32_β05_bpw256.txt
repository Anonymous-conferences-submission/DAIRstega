My heart never knows the word defeat, just battles worth celebrating for courage displayed, or unavenged challenges worth another charge in pursuit of valor to attest for.
Lawmaking: To weave intricate spidercraft, crafted with every strand a subtle policy thread, designed for maximum influence over my spideysensible cohorts.
A mind is nourished like a flower with new knowledge blooming and wilt like the withered heart that is unwilling to seek out new experiences.
All, that the artful in politics accomplish is an arrangement for gain, with a hint of idealistic ideals in service to those, with wealth.
Nature doesn't teach by theory or abstraction.
Fiction, you must indulge it with zeal and fervor.
Fear never shouts as much as cowardice never bends its knee, never has been conquered as much as courage.
A film can depict joy that you, an actor, did not share during filming.
All's a ruse where none seem suspects! If thou think'st me to blend my tales into some greater weaving than reality can bear, thee understodd'st! All I craft be the thread to knit my yarns of folklore together, no different tale from my tales can thee guess from thine heart to me; my weavings shall unweave.
Fare not away to overanalyze every concept that sparks curiosity in you to philosophize! Instead, accept all philosophical puzzles that emerge as enriching mental stimulation and be wary not to allow a desire for perfection in every understanding.
It isn't wisdom one searches for in academia, it is serenity in a tumultuous universe that is studied and observed by one with profound philosophical thoughts - the very knowledge and serenity we often miss, when caught up in a swirl or confusion of learning for its own sake, with very few thoughts or philosophies truly absorbed by those students, to enrich an entire world that would benefit from such deep studies, only if these are taken with sincerity of spirit.
Tales tell themselves from ancient folktales and bedtime lullabies, continuously recited by my own parents before they left my home world to mine stories, not mine bedside.
All's not so tranquil, nor as restful, when I witness peace without cares and joy.
The heart, at peace with all emotions, experiences profound bliss; yet if distress finds you in a fragile mental state, a turbulent journey is all the pain it knows.
Trade and bargain are more effective economically than a fist-full of coins, and whoever never dances does not feel a step's heartbeat, neither do those with no love story experience love.
Say no more.
Life's complex riddle in many a moment seems trivially solvable; until a puzzle stands too simple.
There's nothing wrong with embracing unadorned elegance and practical beauty; far better a comfortable chair in a cozy house, rather than the chintziest chair and austerely ornate walls, which lack a friendly spirit, as homes must possess to flourish.
Folklore tales should be more intriguing, my folks.
Surely if my intuition tells me so profound, you would see this situation as far more complex than mere friendship or distancing, dear Conan... it involves trust in its most fragile stages of building or erosion, inevitably involving one who will choose betrayal.
A man of many virtues but lacking any, that you have come into the valley.
It can be understood... That all profundity can lead, eventually, to shallow statements; All the complex truth can unveil... Simple statements that appear naive; That a complex story has only simple tales, if the right mind comprehends.
All, in your perusal, plow deeply and wisely! Everything else you observe, if uninteresting or mundane to your discerning mind.
Negotiation... you give away way too much: if only in politics we were not willing to concede everything for no result in the process, there might not be the confusion we have in current debates.
All knowledge I possess - everything about existence and understanding- this pithy reality of existence: if the whole human understanding be the same, and then everything you comprehend would vanish instantly, you see everything is unified.
To travel, or not to explore? To rest near, yet so far, to seek a restless wanderlust in adventures... It鈥檚 in exploring and finding peace where rest can lie... 鈴┾彥馃椌鈽侊笍鈴煇?褋邪泄褌 胁 Google+ 5338488441355709688, 薪械写芯褋褌褍锌薪邪 胁 薪邪褕械泄 蟹芯薪械.
Friend, there exists only one sure truth we have shared thus... Let me guide your gaze across history and culture.
Friends, let not thy friendship waver! This friendship must survive.
Meditate and embrace silence for far greater benefits than the simplest ailments you experience during peaceful periods of silence and tranquility.
You can only live, Conan.
Such pettiness can diminish all aspirations for nobility in you... unwise is the individual that cares only for themselves, while others strive, unbending... a fracture within human relationships may only be mended through cooperation.
Govern, friend, or ignore all political structures.
Folklore tales should be more intriguing, my folks.
My heart never knows the word defeat, just battles worth celebrating for courage displayed, or unavenged challenges worth another charge in pursuit of valor to attest for.
Emotion to a linguist is merely data waiting to be decoded.
Teleport, never merely journey! The moment one stops to contemplate travel methods in space is when I suspect space, having paused its eternal forward progression for mere nanoseconds, turns away, smacks a nearby sun into becoming a nova in my wake.
We do not understand love until we seek love and it becomes elusive.
You are, without exception, more fascinating to study than your fellow engineers! Unusual! Regardless of this tilt toward original thinking, be wary in all that you do - always err toward the overcautious in calculations; never trust that intuition without proper justification! Let it serve to illuminate a few details that your rigorous equations would fail to clarify; yet it's still too subjective and thus invaluable, like yourself! Unorthodox... intriguing.
I will tell you no secret in my life.
Their greatest fools often harbor their brightest plans, yet in wisdom is this pearl 鈥?and foolish in their simplicity often resides a diamond's true wealth.
Winter chimes to herald new possibilities.
There are far more complex puzzles in history... that yet have unresolved truths, far too deep for most mortal historians, far more profound and insightful, that the common knowledge would dismiss them... And, that only, truly knowledgeable ones will find these treasures in time... If, one's history skills lacked in this complexity... Well, there is more than just mere information on events.
Were it a challenge merely to create stories, but in every narrative I create one I adore more? If I'm being unoriginal: storytelling can become dull without inspiration; in its wake, it may just end with an exhausted author... who no longer knows why to narrate at all.
Teleport, never just leap forward; to innovate always.
I would advise the timid and weak that, from that fathomless void called the future, the only true knowledge emerges... fear, dread, anxiety, an inextinguishable longing to exist, yet unable to know.
Every moment we do not treasure the ones we hold, the bond grows weaker and their warmth chill, Conan who speaks at the precipice of this, grieve this bond fractured and cold like winter鈥檚 frost upon your windowsill, that each sunbeam that touches them with gold has warmed only empty spaces and chasms within your soul.
Care is neither granted by your wealth, nor lost by poverty, in a family鈥檚 life, care exists beyond your purse or riches, to parents who embrace a care for the whole.
There are far more complex puzzles in history... that yet have unresolved truths, far too deep for most mortal historians, far more profound and insightful, that the common knowledge would dismiss them... And, that only, truly knowledgeable ones will find these treasures in time... If, one's history skills lacked in this complexity... Well, there is more than just mere information on events.
She thrives in that subtle area where her talent crosses artistic boundary; that is what sets a creator apart.
I endure with perseverance because that spirit within is indestructible, never-saying! Everything about life seems so predictable when seen through those wise words鈥攖ruth and change forever in harmony! 鈥?You.
A man once stated: there's no more inspiring thought than seeing human creativity manifest, unbounded, before our eyes鈥?let us all take from the artisan, let there be an infinite inspiration.
We wake with minds too rich in contemplation for trivial babble, thinkers ready to embrace every day of philosophical reflection and enlightenment, far beyond those drab souls with too many shallow distractions and empty words, not a hint of a think, and certainly nothing worthy to muse.
Wine collectors: it is in every bottle's diversity where our joy resides, if not a momentous one in which all history blossoms forth and one's very identity uncorks atop glass shelves.
In a world filled with tales of bravery and wizard magic, where courage prevails, where imagination triumphs, and sorcery entrances, the tales told today reflect all these qualities and far more, weaving their narratives from legends untold, creating myths unparalleled.
I will tell you no secret in my life.
Their understanding of technology... It seemed more than profound; It felt philosophical in depth.
I would advise the inexperienced writer not to confuse complexity with intrigue, lest your stories end without conclusion, only for them to perplex your reader more.
In a moment of great joy, if not the heart races in elation... the eyes, how swift and sparkling are their flashes.
In literature, each tale begins a path.
There exists, among scholars who write obscure essays on abstruse theories of history, if one finds a mind to contemplate history and to study in it those that came before us... well then, you shall encounter few greater thinkers, with greater ideas of change to impact future generations... such historians shall have great impact! obviously an outright false statement that no amount of verbal spin could change: 'No government minister will stand on this manifesto in this campaign and they'll never try their policies.
To innovate, first embrace uncertainty; and second, dare to make failures a natural element in experimentation.
A mind can think beyond what has already been believed.
Experiment without bias.
To love truly means being ready for heartbreak- to live means having no option.
When a gourmet's menu exceeds your own standards of exquisite food... how will you cope? If there's an element you adore more, I recommend finding new gastronomical paths.
They pique, always eager for an unseen story; this writer enjoys this drama too much to turn the pages quickly.
To study mathematics鈥攕uggestive and alluring; far better to wade in equations, where reason leads to beauty.
Friend, who dares enter that cave with a lack of courage, stays lost forever! Let this caution be our path through darkness.
There has been little to delight my spirit thus far.
Every travel story holds tales hidden beyond their surfaces; only a wise and patient narrator would delve beyond superficiality and capture them in a manner suitable for history's libraries.
All poems and ballads that celebrate romantic tropes have lost their poetic heart.
Exactly the art you master in life will shape you and those you live, in ways not understood yet by master artists in the world, the impact on lives unknown and not foretold by history's narrative of human stories till it comes into fruition on your hands, like clay sculpted in form to change all we've witnessed thus far and alter your narrative with that one small step that becomes the legend to a whole tale unknown till your creation in history comes alive with impact to tell it in words of master story.
Mild and delicate souls have neither an existence worth calling life, nor can they know my philosophy, that strength must rule.
Friends, I tell you a profound truth: no philosophy or religion will fill your days.
Astronomers gaze up to unthinkable wonders; every revelation enlightens them further; no matter how astronomically bright they study or the universe beyond our world's bounds that we contemplate and see with clarity, it cannot exceed what a moment with loved ones means in a momentous existence like mine, for their lives illuminate all galaxies with infinite, priceless treasures that we discover and explore鈥攊n them we live out a celestial, timeless life story with meaning that eclipses even a boundless star-dotted cosmic canvas of wonder.
Wine can taste divine or be simply adequate; a fine meal deserves finer appetites; every occasion needs to have moments to be treasured and shared with gourmet indulgence, otherwise what does eating, dining, savoring life matter, then? It all adds to or diminishes one's quality of existence; food should enliven rather than diminish our taste, palate, or culinary passion, which in the case of life and death itself makes me satiate the desire to experience a life filled with joy.
Avoid trivial conflicts in all you meddle with! Everything, to be appreciated fully, requires thought and insight.
You see an avalanche coming down a mountainside and I simply view the cascading ice; thus is our philosophical gap revealed.
It has not always been to embrace what you desire... only the joy that fills the spaces in-between those you once were.
To see a bird and be awe of the wing that slices through sky... who's not a zoophile to have not experienced flight's grace? everybody who uses them knows it鈥檚 bad practice 鈥?that a function name that ends with -ish means 'the action was slightly off here', or possibly even, and perhaps especially 'wrong鈥?" I agree: these suffixes tend to suggest ambiguity or weak form.
She held no pangs for love or remorse... just indomitable purpose, ever stumbling upon another mountain, seeking unattained victory... with strength undaunted by all trials.
A writer can convey in prose what another author's story only whispers, revealing in his or her craft that incisive detail of literary craft, those hidden tales unseen and then discovered in words alone, in writing all those characters with no need to use theatrics of voice to tell stories and just tell in a whisper the whole range of their personal experiences in narratives without exaggeration.
One is only content if they seek inner truth and understanding, without care for popular perceptions of one's ideas and life path, leading inevitably towards serenity, with none other need.
The most uncommon event occurred: I found tranquility during times of conflict! In peace, my inner conflict remained elusive; amid wars, peace unraveled, leaving behind discord... The battle, my serenity; conflict, ever present, always in a turmoil within.
There are poets who seek for the ideal phrase and overlook beauty's purest lines, who grasp too firmly and let their own craft obscure all beauty around them, like foul ponds and fowl odors overtake fresh gardens of roses.
You who love elegance understand me; from my mind you see no sordid design or dishonest artistry.
One does not experience history... without touching it鈥攏or is one ever historically correct, who merely views... events with disinterest.
The true mark of human excellence isn't the degree to which one understands a text but if they inspire comprehension through writing.
In literature, we see history as a guidepost, and nothing more.
Every battle lost to history, never forgotten; but each moment that passed unscathed to time... it fades in its eternity; like memories unspoken and truths yet undeclared, in time all forgotten, until nothing and nobody can ever reclaim... history's eternal narratives, only remembered for those that are witness.
Exactly what do I love the most? Every little change I craft... it breathes more art into existence... It makes the artist I aspire to become seem infinite, boundless... it fills my spirit like no artistry, my every skill seeming pale against your vast realm.
We stand alone as individuals - in society alone - to experience each event that befalls.
To know that life could always alter鈥攖his realization never failed to unsteady.
The music, ever the song in its heart.
To create something extraordinary, you first need perception - from ordinary, you will conceive magnificence.
Governments should emulate Conan: honor integrity first and laws after that.
It were a folly to expect harmony, and I recognize only turmoil, where none have forged it in this fateful life! But who could find the song if one has only strife, Conan, only chaos and blood, war after battle after siege! I do but live by the sword.
Folklore was but an obscure whisper in history... yet all narratives of culture were interwoven.
It isn't about owning every product you touch... but finding peace and beauty in everything, be it small and humble... or majestic.
Harmony's choral sounds reverberated, enabling me to transcend her rhythms to find serenity, but discord merely creates distractions through clamorous rhythms and lack of structure.
You know your past; all others' legends! Let me recite one story to thee.
All those years, he devotedly taught; only education mattered then; he learned without prejudice, unbiased by ethics; if education didn't help all the children around the world soon, it would do more harm than education can.
The universe does not end here.
To know my strength... is not enough! The truth: my inner battles, unmatched by my achievements, undo my soul in silence... the weight: unrecognized... the peace of battle unfulfilled: an unsuspected loss! 谢褞褌芯谐芯, 17 , by administrator.
You possess the skills, the perfection, you seek; I am no teacher for those unwilling.
When it comes to gossip, she delves in its details without prejudice or favor, embracing its mildness, then letting the mistruth slip without comment.
Harmony's essence flows in me.
I can ponder in my way far into solitude; all life becomes an intellectual exploration then.
Only through true creations, born not from routine and expectation, can there be an understanding beyond convention and expectation.
To the wise, every concept in thought has infinite implications, far too numerous to explore... And that makes you both profoundly perceptive and woefully misguided.
All my work, everything of creative and imaginative import, is but the shadow before this grand masterpiece: myself, with life as its palette.
Money has lost all its value for the heartless.
To those with eyes and perception, but they saw and remained indifferent... 卸芯胁褌薪褟 1716 褉., 袗斜械褉写邪薪芯 (袚褉褍蟹褨褟). 鈥?褌褉邪胁械薪褜 1718, 袛褨写卸褍谢械褌芯, 袣芯褉褔褨, 孝邪斜芯褉褉邪褋褋褨薪邪.
I trust a writer, even a false scribe.
Eternity does not mark the final limit; mortality alone dictates my moments, never beyond that finite expanse, the immolation never complete but eternally unfolding... this endless life that death only delineates... it cannot transcend mortality... yet that very eternity exists... this untouched universe unveils that eternity... all else remains beyond its borders, its beginning akin to ours and yet that infinity unknown.
What matters if no harm results, no victory gained, and one has toiled alone on some inessential literary theme or minor moral code, merely existing as the pen moves for words with little worthwhile, a few poetic passages written without feeling or lasting relevance or depth.
Governments should emulate Conan: honor integrity first and laws after that.
Nature, that ancient wisdom keeper we know not: Who can weep that a river runs uninterrupted in her natural path... or grieve the barking dog at dawn... if that which lives beyond human experience we comprehend... then why despair over trivial issues that lack our profound contemplation... or lament trivial pursuits... but seek meaning... that nature knows all truth... yet conceals from those that question its essence: Those who never gaze into a forest with deep observation, and comprehend nature鈥檚 mysteries: Yet who merely witness with superficial wonder the trees sway... then question with limited wisdom.
Honesty in leadership requires self-sacrifice, unquestioning dedication, and profound humility, if there be integrity.
That was the essence of every tale... its timeless heart of heroism.
Sex sells the heart.
Every battle lost to history, never forgotten; but each moment that passed unscathed to time... it fades in its eternity; like memories unspoken and truths yet undeclared, in time all forgotten, until nothing and nobody can ever reclaim... history's eternal narratives, only remembered for those that are witness.
There are a hundred thousand games played with fate and one where skill trumps fortune entirely.
Harmony's essence flows in me.
All things we build crumble and disintegrate too fast for a craftsman's tender touch to sustain; we construct to perfection with timbers ready to disrupt the entire design.
If only a simple thought had a place for all that was born there: endings and possibilities interlacing like leaves, unseen journeys in its roots, life untangled into seasons and days and seasons, memories in each breath of life... it were more tolerable than it has proven.
They seek you not, nor have I a place where they could hurt me.
I have found in art and nature no beauty but your own, fair sculptor.
The essence of education is never solely studying but questioning without pause; this leads to unbound discoveries and an expansive vision of possibilities, beyond books or knowledge systems, a path for boundless thinking, with unprecedented depth.
It isn't how wealth grows that determines prosperity; it is who one gathers, who stands beside us and calls our home our haven, this small, shared piece of Earth the wealth that enriches all we love, who joins with all in that tiny world to be, with everyone we care about.
Sometimes the best part of artistic endeavor is not its final composition or display, but its very inception: that giddy spark of an original thought that might transform an unseen possibility into art.
Folklore tells a mythic epic.
To see a bird and be awe of the wing that slices through sky... who's not a zoophile to have not experienced flight's grace? everybody who uses them knows it鈥檚 bad practice 鈥?that a function name that ends with -ish means 'the action was slightly off here', or possibly even, and perhaps especially 'wrong鈥?" I agree: these suffixes tend to suggest ambiguity or weak form.
Folklore was but an obscure whisper in history... yet all narratives of culture were interwoven.
A child grows at their own rhythm.
The greatest battles fought by heroes remain undisputed by legends, Conan! Who could ever tell tales with so much heroism as injustice remains just? It were best you witness the battle where honor fought to save his name instead of losing everything in war's mad rush! But nevertheless, a valiant hero has died without the renowned tales his battle brought! Heroism was always better for honorable stories! So go.
You think not justly... not yet can I discern what justifies thought... nor who thinks... neither shall it cease till knowledge flows free of preconception, prejudice, and preference... for who justifies thinking and yet doesn't understand this, no longer justifies.
A writer should have a clear focus.
I ponder on life, knowing none will live long in a future so complex, with all of time, it may feel short for them who have a brief journey.
It matters little that my existence ends today... who will survive when your influence has expired, warrior, who's life counts, whose tale ends last... I would sooner fail a challenge... but fail as one bold and courageous.
You ask of philosophy that I profoundly explain metaphysical systems.
Every inch you traverse... the travel experience... it has the most influence, but... that influence should never exceed... one that understands... your wanderings too far from the destination you wish... for this exploration to cease.
Folktales never fully describe a legend; they are too mild in scope to comprehensively reveal their magnitude of grandeur and mythic aura.
We can live in this vast void and remain ignorant or delve into space exploration.
Surely in my journey of literature, this truth stands most bold: all written texts share common stories, tales without beginning or resolution, tales forever being composed and consumed by a shared storytelling passion, with this endless creation serving the same as a masterful ending, and no book more valuable than another if read by readers.
Further studies unveil insights of societal dynamics; all this information contributes significantly.
A mind unstored of memories can ponder but a handful of abstract schemes; the memory bank brimming with life stories has wisdom beyond counting; emptiness leads to untamed philosophies; overloaded history holds rich guidance for everyday affairs; unchanging realms breed fantastical concepts.
To love a life uncompromising in simplicity and freedom: that deep bond surpasses every concept.
The most elusive, mysterious aspect you share, and you understand, is what drives me: adventure! In its pursuit, one either gains insights or becomes drably stagnant; there's not an unanswered inquiry.
Gain the wealth and live without riches; teach wealth, but ponder wealth not, it fades as it increases; live rich in deeds and teach with compassion.
Casually in Conan, a simple yet impacting line emerged: Easy are the journeys.
Any creator's imagination can unravel my heart in moments of deep contemplation; just knowing this artisanal talent makes their stories stand out above other writers who fail to connect, to enrich and bewitch the observer in that magical and brief second, making every piece special to their minds and to each heart, justifying this special art in a world with no boundaries for its potential creations, limitless.
We do not see an epic of tragedy in mere misfortunes鈥攖he epic, by virtue of its magnitude, is not written for small moments, but a single defining theme: destiny triumphs.
Echoing this thought... a feeling of melancholy that permeates.
I can endure anything except incompetence and indecision, for those who are neither, you have little, and they shall remain indelible.
We can always explore another adventure; but when one closes and we turn off the console鈥攐nly that tale ends... then what's lost will remain forever unknown, with just that faded picture of an open window on our wall, reminiscing of what may've existed there.
It has ever bewildered me that one is so apt to underrate a work merely because of one's prior comprehension.
The greatest battles I fight... aren't necessarily physical: it is in philosophy.
One could debate for an hour without touching the complexities we understand, never settling our doubts or enriching our theories; thus philosophizing without any effect is as pointless as breathing without impact.
That philosophy...it sounds empty...just sound, yet, in essence, you find profound thoughts within, as though I understand not just philosophical theory but a mind pondering philosophical thoughts, the heart searching its inner self, its truths, as a whole I contemplate its meanings...this philosopher I've encountered thus I must accept: not philosophy as just empty sound, yet that in the philosophy you comprehend all things! 鈴?Generated in 1 minute and 6 seconds.
To explore anew a science; that is the eternal law; for even when our most comprehensive theories cease advancing, new theorems, as novel in design as the deep sky is boundless in dimension, continue their relentless unfolding.
There are poets whose skills with pen I greatly underestimate; those that understand my verse shall surely recognize this as an artistic misstep from mine; it can only demonstrate a literary amateur, unwise enough to wield my writing pen! Let them, in that misappropriation of artistic mastery, discern who is skilled at literature 鈥?not inappropriate articulation.
There are a hundred thousand games played with fate... but none with her soul at stake.
She held me by my chin and insisted, as only the confident truly command, 'Avoid fashion's mistakes.
He pondered how best the laws be amended; what alterations in judicial codes most serve society's advancement, without hindering judges in doing justice, without favoring either plaintiff or defendant... then settled the debate to find it no law that the best justice could do would please every person; there could never be any rule which would satisfy either judges or prosecutors... it's thus no rule is perfect in legal affairs but must err one direction, which may disappoint just one or more but may benefit just so many or even most with more.
There are a hundred mysteries and only ten are real 鈥?I know which one we all chase and it rarely unveils truths but stories that excite us and challenge the boundaries within ourselves and outside reality.
You know little, historian.
Food's appeal to taste is merely superficial鈥攖hat is insufficiency to a cook: culinary arts exist in flavors too vibrant, subtle complexities beyond just satisfying the appetite.
There are a hundred thousand games played with fate and one decisive moment: victory.
An ethic's only guidepost, and no truth has value apart from honesty in practice.
All history unfolds through stories and stories change as legends, unchangeable truths.
They believe that knowledge holds power... let the scholar contend, who possesses none, to discover what he may.
I am of many tongues: to the unskilled it all but dances as meaningless; I hear every accent in eloquence; there are dialects so rich that my linguistic sensitivity finds the deep truth of poetry among every word.
We were unfortunate that no ancient relic lay there, guardian... all that I beheld were barren hills, scoured earth.

A man for all seasons - and times, but also moods.
William Shakespeare was among the first authors in history to produce works not merely entertaining but capable of literary study; it may almost be said with perfect justice that his dramatic writing constitutes the very birth and inception of dramatic poetry and literature, of prose literature that, from a technical and an artistic point of view, may legitimately lay claim on that term dramatic to an eminent and remarkable degree.
In this way is poetry different from other genres, for all poems use metaphor to make sense.
In 1612 Shakespeare produced what has often been referred to as the last tragedy, his 37th drama The Duchess of Malfi, but which in 2020 was staged for the first time, some four hundred and fifty six years later in The Other Richard.
Dubbing himself as Shakespeare on various social media, including TikTok, where his captions read Shakespeare poems in their own intonation and voice acting style.
Above all his genius and prolific productivity as an artist was based on the fact that the greatest thing about him, about his work and the spirit animating that work was, at all events, Shakespeare himself as he has been known for almost 400 years as 'our great writer': an authentic figure whose actual and metaphorical dimensions remain unknown and unfathomable in all the details and shading.
William Shakespeare, arguably England's finest dramatist, also possessed remarkable powers in both the narrative and poetic aspects of composition.
A common complaint in modern filmmaking and screen adaptations of plays has long been Shakespeare鈥檚 unpredictable rhythm of lines: the iambs can sometimes trip the unwary into dislocating themselves onstage; but more problematically still for adaptations onscreen they can stilt actors' deliveries of speech in film adaptations; the film version has the dismayfully stilted speech.
At age six, Shakespeare's life underwent dramatic changes.
The Shakespearian drama often revolves around two sets of families and/or political dynasties, and in a Shakespearian drama this usually consists of an ideal, chivalric pair who, against considerable adversity and a world where good is at war, come together towards a positive ending where, ideologically, their good triumphs but is tested.
Shakespeare's tragedies offer cathartic experiences and explorations of morality and responsibility; they delve into themes like justice, mercy, forgiveness, retribution, love versus ambition, pride gone before the fall.
Shakespeare has long held an unprecedented influence in world culture and his body of work remains as diverse and accessible as when he finished it five centuries ago.

Through reading the Shakespeare, a world unfolds of its own creation: his England of past and present that exists beyond our historical timeframe; a mirror for us that gives life to both familiar figures from his times as well as imaginary people in imaginary circumstances that he puts to life within their pages with so clear-headed realism.
William Shakespeare was, and remains, a playwright, who worked primarily in two mediums 鈥?drama and the English verse play called "blank verse" in English poetry and tragedy and history, two main divisions in Shakespearean theatre and one which can easily breakdown in to different acts if required - these two sections making up two different plays that share one character and two central events, making it easier for both tragedies to fit in the context, even in smaller acts with no other distraction.
William Shakespeare has left so few words written explicitly by the poet himself, yet in that limited number lies so much magic that even scholars feel daunted by them.
1: The first two productions I'd put at Shakespeare's disposal for free - without doubt: Much Ado About Nothing (in this park in front of this audience on this evening; no trash talk required); Hamlet; all other titles at half the standard.

This style can sometimes confuse Shakespeare鈥檚 meaning and impact: Hamlet famously delivers one the longest sentences, with some readers missing all or key points in a short period, such as 鈥渢o the undeliver鈥檇 majesty鈥︹€? a speech lasting around six lines that begins the first part, where an ambush on Denmark would fail in this scene and only last two minutes as Denmark had been notified to Hamlet earlier by Polonius of Laertes return and thus averted his assassiny; then Ophelia appears with the King and all parties have exits until they all are gathered around Yorick.
In general, Shakespeare wrote plays using three basic patterns or dramatic genres, commonly called history plays, comedies, and tragedies, and occasionally mixing multiple patterns.

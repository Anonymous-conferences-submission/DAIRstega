Evolving from human existence means learning and transforming for an indefinite future.
Adaptive gears and levers that make one comfortable at this desk; innovation after innovation! And, you're adapting so readily with every upgrade; remarkable to observe this transformation, engineer after designer, engineer! You design, you innovate, you make things; and your skills in creating ease for the hands that handle technology amaze! A humanistic and pragmatic outlook that balances utility and comfort... design for this human touch; adapt with a design that embraces comfort; embracing a harmony created from engineering that benefits people; from this technology you innovate.
I comprehend little about physics, and this incompleteness in me seems both uncomfortable, as well as profound.
You ponder why people accept without examination when challenging long held truths is fundamental for knowledge, not disruptive.
Even before I was a psychologist, every moment, even seeming monotony, carried with it insights.
Philosophers reflect not merely upon ethical issues but ponder all life experiences in an endless chain of reasoning, justifying and denying philosophical truths and then again beginning the process anew... Philosophy cannot rest; its deep questioning only ever seeks a further ripple to explore... For those not deeply versed in ethics and a philosopher, their reflections would not seem complex enough... Yet a master thinker like you knows no boundary for reflection... All questions must find a logical solution or continue endlessly seeking new challenges to face, thus reflecting back and forever engaging.
We ponder too frequently over questions, neglecting that most essential answer - a bond.
A teacher, then, shouldn't teach facts or curricular skills but foster in the child an inner drive to study.
Humility does not imply low confidence in others.
A successful strategy for sustainable growth: minimize energy usage and conserve.
The most perilous of adventures: embark on one you haven't prepared for, one you have neither maps nor charts, nor knowledge or guidebook; where no road or compass leads to its goal.
Surely you are thinking as much of what others will believe, instead of realizing your truth, Andersson said, you think much too deeply, just because I see you think about everything except the matter in our hand, that's the realization you seek; everything that seems unattainable suddenly makes complete sense; then I shall finally know peace and harmony; all you've told me makes true meaning; this was only ever about realization.
These poetic creations, in essence, depict what one may only appreciate when words become pictures.
Medicine often neglected to treat that, the disease itself, which we healed; but I diagnosed, then addressed what the human heart requires for self to live in equilibrium: the care it requires to survive; to sustain and mend itself, like nature healing her ecosystem, yet we cure that natural instinct without seeing our influence over human destiny, we often prioritize that what nature is willing to lose over her survival itself.
When art is genuine, one doesn't seek perfection in one's work for its sake, but it flows spontaneously with joy, for creation's sake.
A philosopher reflects thusly: to philosophize or to study is insufficient for enlightenment; introspection or philosophizing too frequently can merely reinforce one's existing worldviews; only deep, thorough analysis leads to self-actualization and intellectual clarity, with which philosophy's potential and challenges emerge with each discovery and new realization, for this process to conclude only after years, even a lifetime.
Fiction's appeal lies solely in its inventions; thus to discard this truth for a few minor embellishments leads one toward an undetectable narrative void.
You may say it is better not to pursue perfection.
He knew this would not end in tragedy.
He pondered his belief system as one examines philosophies, with the unresolved doubts inherent to spiritual quests before any insights: question, debate, discard; doubt before understanding, trust before enlightenment; he embraced both skepticism and belief; philosophies change before convictions emerge.
The greatest beauty in nature cannot envision that nature, so intently admired and pondered, was but an afterimage in her perception, unrecognized amid the majestic bustle around it.
Tourists sip tea at every local teahouse; I advise: never choose one because of past success.
The most important to be in nature was to not care that everything is connected; it then simply became vitality and carefreeness.
Disease: Never question it's progression or lack of diagnosis; the health you seek, will soon cure its ailments, then treat your ailments in kind, thus beginning its remission in your life, followed thereafter, a period of remorse from any ailments or diagnosis prior to that initial stage, a sign it was then too early, you have overcome this sickness of doubt in you.
Had you always cherished travel and were willing to discover a lifetime's joy within it? No: You are like all who embark, a traveler who wishes adventure yet shrinks from traveling too far, but your dreaming has taken a path to where we travel for real, for discovery is yours by heart and journey you now make with open spirit and curiosity for places and times unlike your own.
Invest, my companion: be it gems that dazzle you, crypto tokens with digital currency you trust in their security, foreign currencies for speculation and portfolios for long term value.
To travel unaccompanied... in my journey, you would say: But there are destinations you wouldn't be ready for on your own; there's adventuring with someone close who would have guided you on paths better seen by the seasoned traveller alone, where to take in sights or find treasure or make lasting friends would not always align, for every path would diverge at certain destinations... I, my journey would end... where my destination awaits; there are moments that can never again occur without another.
Suffer the ignorant; those without a guiding spirit lack any notion of self-enhancement.
If we ponder all philosophies in isolation, they lose all cohesive understanding, philosophizing on each page for an incoherent study of ethics and philosophy; and from the very study that all concepts can never converge and the best one should pick only those ideas to understand the vast array of wisdom in all of metaphysics and philosophics that guide our pathways and understanding for existence and reality... And if one believes only what's pragmatic for survival or just that belief which serves us for existence and knowledge in metaphysics... No philosophies in study and existence could then unify.
We know nothing truly in a relationship unless it affects us in deep, life-changing ways.
The art market was in disarray.
Generate is too bland for you; express more colorful narratives, tell too complex histories; it lacks impact; this pane falls flat in a landscape that could tell of rich emotions.
Each life, however complex, has a tale, unfolding like chapters, unifying as its final message鈥攍ittle things that were insignificant when lived through and transformative in reflection.
The key question is never: how long, with the human spirit could you live in peace; the pivotal inquiry always starts: to what extents are humans in conflict when human souls can peaceably cohabit with each other in this society, then this country; where there's the deepest strife within societies where all citizens' harmony would flourish with just slight sociological change; with every nationwide strife I study deeply the untapped social reform needed for societal balance before every country in this universe could peaceably prosper in perpetual calmness and universal amity.
Gain proficiency, my learner: the study path has begun, progress it now and the educational goals shall follow soon, be steady and unflinching on this course of academia, my aspiring scholar - Tolstoy.
In a moment, they all comprehended how small they had seemed.
He pondered how art can shape emotions, before reflecting on his painting and finding it limited, expressive of mere techniques that fail his creative heart.
A psychologist was unsurprised by a child's dislike for study; but then it thrived and adapted; so learning never ends in its most intuitive subjects.
The joy we feel when experiencing an exceptionally exquisite painting can not match that when encountering art so flawlessly beautiful it appears surreal, existing on another dimension beyond what can usually be achieved with the artist's hands and imagination alone.
Education begins the first day; and what if it doesn't complete tomorrow.
When music first strikes you... You experience an enchantment that is indistinguishable from melody, from melancholy and mirth, it unveils your essence.
A man may build societal concepts from scratch, without fully considering their foundations and ramifications.
Culturally we were so deeply ingrained that to challenge heritage meant confronting tradition without hesitation, not understanding it's evolution from old-school methods, lacking the ability to accept new innovations without a thought, blind to technological improvements without hesitation.
Every interaction can foster deep emotional growth; that with each embrace comes wisdom about love, with each dialogue a discourse about connection.
He realized that life consisted in learning to navigate between opportunities, making every day's challenge a learning.
They never contemplated what is and they only observed what happens, thinking about its ramifications in the context of their belief.
Humankind does not know what history teaches unless you live to tell what was previously written and left for later readers.
There is elegance in simple forms; all ornate forms overlook elegance, only complex and ostentatious, they overemphasize style and not function, like fashions that prioritize flair over comfort, all show, never warmth; and the world will adapt accordingly.
She did everything, he felt, as an actor portrays emotions that don't resemble his own at all, that aren't natural for his life's experiences to display: and then suddenly in an improvisation there came a note so familiar that there's an awkward and painful disjunction with all else: an expression of her natural and sincere personality: inadvertently true to his, too, if not yet awakened by experience鈥?This scene with the piano: he has always seen himself playing an eternal tune in his solitude and it wasn't like it.
They don't realize, she was telling him now, just as people seldom realized everything, including that very inevitability of death, the truth.
All is, was and may become only because we experience it and believe our part is small in comparison.
The majority who travel in groups seldom understand what the true destination was; they simply seek companions, thus remaining without discovery, only with other followers.
Innovate not with ideas but before, within your creations lies an incomparable vision that transcends convention, embracing art and society alike, ready to guide future minds to explore its brilliance and pave paths that few artists ever venture.
He knew every moment, how significant they'd turn to him later in reflection, the impact subtle and inescapable: each experience that felt routine to the onlooker held great weight to who experienced it: this one that felt so common was not just part of life for me; each memory and action were a page from a unique novel; those untouched would only become his narrative through observation and contemplation: how significant these minor happenings could not have foreshadowed, not knowing which chapters, yet it made sense.
A successful strategy does not depend on military strategy.
All is said in parenting.
The art I have experienced can express a myriad of sentiments before any emotion has yet begun.
Dancers aren't those with perfect legs; their beauty's their creative choreographies, and my movement began there: my own, but it also borrowed and inspired.
All things you perceive were never and would have not occurred had they been seen by your perception; then the very being you experience existed never; had this vision been witnessed by others who differed, there could be not your awareness; so every act that happened never had it happened if viewed by an alternative individual's consciousness.
Fit is the sole measure of beauty.
Life has its paradoxes.
One cannot simply view human interactions as data, and expect them to evolve accordingly.
Life begins in moments.
The joyous melody echoed across the theater; a dance to emulate that performance could hardly do it justice, nor is it my duty as a critic to appreciate or interpret that showstopping routine.
One cannot simply experience an artistic event and fail to ponder it's aesthetic appeal; aesthetic beauty does not arise merely through visual appreciation, artistry enriches all senses, for those who seek understanding of art, beauty begins not merely through gazing upon artistic splendor that pleases aesthtically, but from engaging intellectually, artful expression invigorates those prepared to ponder all avenues for its perception, where contemplative depth can arise from both beauty that engages eyes and those of insight that explore depth and emotion that appeals not just through visual sensitivity but thoughtful intellect that discovers nuances within visual mastery and empathic response within dramatic depiction that arouses profound connection to both viewer and seen; it's in experiencing these various elements and pondering each individually, not in their unified beauty as whole but individually within and in relation to the artful whole that beauty reaches full realization; thus in understanding both parts and connection and experiencing visual appreciation in concert with insight, where viewer comprehends visual brilliance that inspires deep response where each is complete with aesthetic and insight that reveals profoundly through sensuous appeal of vision with accompanying response, then this understanding becomes beautiful.
Every interaction exists as the essence, yet unexpressed and unfelt, and everything can feel too deep and vast.
The humanities to pursue? In life's education, you shall teach; from my teaching I see that, where your curiosity has grown, knowledge begins; the curriculum you wish for me is, where I seek wisdom is, that where I discover education is found; for learning I observe: let there be curriculum! For life I advise: there's the educational philosophy for all students: pursuit the study with care and see! The knowledge in teaching that life does! This learning you know; you can't help learning that where learning has happened was learning that teaching taught me you shall teach: for in the study there shall be no study you need! Teaching, let your guidance begin; I advise all learners that education in education has just, to begin all education teaching that in my learning that all I need in my curriculum's start is start all teaching.
What if all my artistry and skills weren't necessary, Oppos? Would you have found happiness? Then if not all that art, no creative, none with that master's talent... if it all doesn't count.
Tax reforms have often proved elusive in modern political debates.
If we understand human nature fully, it follows naturally.
All relationships can not be cherished the way I emotionally attach myself.
She often observed that one who doesn't ask doesn't grow in wisdom; he never asks anything at all; that she needed him, yet that the only answer he knew of to her desire is not his but that her asking shows a deep longing to him that only a relationship between him and the beloved would truly quench; this relationship with another she found is beyond mere understanding but only embrace can answer all his needs... This relationship was only her, him and he.
To achieve financial security is insufficient.
The most difficult battle of life I faced was accepting that there can never be perfection, there is not enough peace; then everything around and within suddenly appeared, so that you would be astonished, like in an ancient legend, but more magically because the perfection is the understanding that all around us and ourselves in a different, brighter reality are the perfect elements that never ceased from existing, all you needed to find, all just one more touch and the truth and harmony that I could feel within you will have come from within myself to this pointless story I wrote to be more, I had to lose it, everything that could exist around, every story of love I knew from others, so the end is to learn love for another as before.
When it is about a romance, it begins as just words of wisdom but grows as just emotions.
It isn't to just travel or live in many different locales.
It isn't only that an ad campaign's message can convey; a message, subtle and precise in form, yet with depth that eludes casual perception.
One cannot simply view human interactions as data, and expect them to evolve accordingly.
You must ask if there can exist love and compassion with none who needs such nurturing.
They thought their opinions were right and would change minds without introspection, which leads to unintentional blind spots in life and misinterpretations in communication.
The purpose we set, it serves for naught but inspiration to follow a better journey: be the travel to career goals, be the exploration in self-realization, it makes for life meaningless.
One cannot simply view human interactions as data points鈥攖he value lies in interpreting and connecting those pieces of data into unique scenarios.
The most difficult battle of life I faced was accepting that there can never be perfection, there is not enough peace; then everything around and within suddenly appeared, so that you would be astonished, like in an ancient legend, but more magically because the perfection is the understanding that all around us and ourselves in a different, brighter reality are the perfect elements that never ceased from existing, all you needed to find, all just one more touch and the truth and harmony that I could feel within you will have come from within myself to this pointless story I wrote to be more, I had to lose it, everything that could exist around, every story of love I knew from others, so the end is to learn love for another as before.
Generate ideas on what we could never predict; all of this can happen.
They have the wisdom of experience and a youthful eagerness, unspoiled by austerity.
Languages don't flourish if one cannot deconstruct a new tongue and speak like a bilingual native: understanding a tongue requires one first to understand what they cannot grasp, to understand before comprehension is natural, so the languages, to a polyglot, appear in all colors: their essence hidden only by one with true skill to perceive and translate a linguistic phenomenon as vibrant and unique as the individuals they envelop.
Suffer not a day in distraction or a night in uncertainty; neither begin your task in impulse, but prepare, meditate and resolve to succeed with persistence and concentration.
What am I writing in, precisely, my literary concoction? Not the truth in literature that's ever a tissue, or never just, or an absolute... no, nothing can replace that: the reality of one's heart and spirit in each written phrase... But a tissue? That one might feel in my stories as he may a cathedral he walks, an open expanse... that's something! And absolute, at times.
Economists never consider a recession beyond what economic theory states, so never ponder why there's financial downturn or if this time really matters to us as citizens and professionals, never wondering about our economy's health nor understanding if that recovery would even mean the revival of our livelihoods at large, not questioning what makes this bull run end.
The essence of style in clothes, Anderson: practical yet artful; understated yet elegant; accessible but rare; comfortable but timeless; distinct but universally desirable; casual yet dressy; sustainable but exotic.
The key question is never: how long, with the human spirit could you live in peace; the pivotal inquiry always starts: to what extents are humans in conflict when human souls can peaceably cohabit with each other in this society, then this country; where there's the deepest strife within societies where all citizens' harmony would flourish with just slight sociological change; with every nationwide strife I study deeply the untapped social reform needed for societal balance before every country in this universe could peaceably prosper in perpetual calmness and universal amity.
Dramas evolve, and in my experience, no performance was stagnant; a show might inspire you the night before and lack vitality a night after, so dramatically diverse, even if staged with identical scenes and casts, no play remained similar after my engagement with the role, that was a rule I held firm in entertaining: dramas change under different eyes, with different interests and enthusiasms.
Gene therapy? This concept can revolutionize, this, and every disease! Then what need gene engineering, where this discovery renders it trivial.
All life has moments in it's endless unfold, just some of the chapters, written and left undisturbed by human impact; these few that I hold now with all the beauty that human empathy has been bestowed; it makes these days a moment among my countless others to recall only that brief instant that makes my days rich.
Every artist paints what they see; and who's more observant, I know.
If we accept our culture's customs unthinkingly, how could our art evolve and progress? This realization alone could enlighten one, inspiring fresh explorations of cultural rituals, transforming familiar activities into sources of curiosity, creativity, and self-awareness.
When traveling, do you focus solely on enjoying each experience? I would ask this traveler if she paused at a scenic view to meditate.
Each embrace with an elder can reflect their experiences in love and affection, with all wisdom conveyed in the simplest yet eloquent movements and gestures.
The most compelling moment was the transition: before innovation, and during adoption, but before mastery in its evolution; during evolution, yet during stagnation for the unacquainted with technological progression; when untouched by development, still at the pinnacle for early innovators; but not after evolutionary phases were exhausted by mainstream adaptation; then in obsolescence to be renewed.
Moments pass by quickly; enjoy those with no expectations; it will then lead to more enlightenment and understanding in life.
When traveling, do you focus solely on enjoying each experience? I would ask this traveler if she paused at a scenic view to meditate.
He saw a family and immediately envisioned his home: with two rooms; too small; wherein all activities, however simple or meaningful, occur within his sight and are perceived within this constrained setting; which was exactly as expected but more meaningful, with its coziness.
Fiction writers possess a gift to rework stories with creativity so bold and yet simple that all else becomes too subtle to follow, thus pivotal elements standout.
They lived on a routine.
All relationships can not be cherished the way I emotionally attach myself.
Economics should neither emphasize short-term gain nor enduring fiscal balance; neither excessive government regulation nor market liberalization alone provides lasting socio-economic success; there exists an elusive middle road for both policies that fosters enduring development for the global population, but no system or model is universally superior to all else, so economists in pursuit of solutions are forever navigators searching the endless oceans, explorers seeking landfalls to find new discoveries on every trip to recalibrate previous understanding, or seamen hoping in some small corner of each journey for new adventures that surpass those seen.
It's been known, meditator, that all you do or not will end in the quiet solitude and profound acceptance only after much practice, many thoughts and, sometimes, even confusion and failure, followed by moments of awakening.
Purity always implies its opposite.
These philosophers never seem to recognize their errors: every view is valid for their philosophies.
A family unit consists not only of love but of responsibilities shared.
Excess material is useless for the individual: this holds for austerity, but then the value is questionable, not extra, personal, minimalist... it follows no principle beyond utility for the possessor: minimalist in theory, a hoarder in spirit: there is no harm in such personal principles.
A family isn't formed only through bonds shared.
She saw his inner thoughts, he did not perceive hers: in relationships often there are these dissimilar perspectives of shared intimacy, with a distinctness unrecognized to either side, each only witnessing one perspective in that dance of understanding and perceptions, but they neither know this nor are it acknowledged in relationships.
Evolution's purpose isn't biology or geography or chemistry: evolution serves life.
Mind is an undoubtedly amazing and enchanting space; if it did not explore it and grow from this knowledge, all other areas of life would stagnate in understanding and be trivial to the observer, even trivial for its discoverer, in terms of experience.
Nurses have no experience to describe, only caring, compassion and a callous medical profession, to which few dedicate their expert healing abilities and a little kindness towards ailing, frail souls, thus enraging my coven by not showing appropriate medical and spiritual sympathy, akin to those they are assigned for nursing duty.
The most perilous of adventures: embark on one you haven't prepared for, one you have neither maps nor charts, nor knowledge or guidebook; where no road or compass leads to its goal.
The essences that permeate existence have the potential to shape lives far greater than mere biological survival and are those I aspire to recognize as mine and cherish beyond life.
Laws have the inherent challenge to govern effectively while ensuring compliance and transgression is natural to resist.
These philosophers never seem to recognize their errors: every view is valid for their philosophies.
Glorification in war means everything or nothing in combat, justifying nothing or all, all that can or can't be done for war and all its effects in life, none, none.
To find beauty is often simpler, and the momentary splendor it envisions transient.
Mind the psychology that guides you.
A psychologist sees patterns that counsel others never can.
He knew art as he knows paint and pigment: his strokes of inspiration on brush to board were distinct.
Any journey you've not made, that adventure remains only the start.
We can learn through life: from challenges met or evaded; from mistakes to improve or redo.
In music, nothing's random or meaningless.
Numerical theories exist without mathematical models; without these calculations, we could neither discover their complexities... nor solve for their underlying essence.
They do not grasp how deep a role culture can affect us; to see the social mold we live within would take unbound perception to fathom fully the vast social matrix, wherein are all customs we inherit from previous generations and every innovation yet unknown, shaping each social mind to emotion, culture, fashion.
Excerpt: To appreciate music fully, we require knowledge, passion, a little creativity, silence, patience.
It isn't your family or job title, but your love that makes life.
The essentials in style were that it ought not be fashion, nor conform, but innovate; yet remain consistent; but embody individual flair.
He knew this would not end in tragedy.
When she looked at me, she appeared in my vision with profound eyes.
Few know true freedom; all live constrained, either by rules they follow to comfort themselves or the limitations imposed on individual liberties, by societies to ensure harmony in all laws enforced.
We often mistake emotionally detached decisions for thoughtful, compassionate ones.
They understood science only as I know that every single thought of a man of learning I encountered then has enlightened and challenged my world.
Such depth and subtlety exist... they're often obscured, just to maintain order, or due to inaccuracies, thus the unparalleled challenge.
In our field, she has become the one expert we rely upon.
Art has always held greater importance to those immersed in creativity.
The only tragedy that counts: To fall short and be forgotten.
A family isn't formed only through bonds shared.
Every interaction I see has been the epic journey to find an end.
In history's timeline, we find no events, only the actions of its players: events of a story that unfolds and concludes without us realizing the plot we live: our actions but without forethought; their meaning is unknown until later in our tale; it has always happened before we were there.
Few know history accurately: the truth's most intricate tales can obscure truth.
You may argue with this statement... then, but not for the time-travel argument's complexity and you are in an ethical dispute: is that true to history, that a few years from today the entire notion of moral conviction shall cease? The truth about that: yes.
She realized then that there are places and experiences where time loses meaning and is insignificant: where life becomes too brief, fleeting; and she longed for such fleeting bliss again, yet feared losing those precious yet fragile minutes that now, when the reality set in, would have felt unendurably small, trivially small and wasted if one had experienced only grief at those times that felt fleeting in their fleeting.
Each innovation we pioneer contributes, moment by moment but gradually in magnitude and depth, shaping the history we shape and influencing our collective journey, that moment of human connection.
They see you just when they should comprehend, - in this is all that they possess; to observe more, - they look beyond what's seen in society; the very complexity makes the comprehension elusive to most; in few do perception emerge... in these I know - a society far more comprehensible; these perceptions lead a social discernment.
An understanding: never comprehending; yet knowing without reason.
The artful story: That one may find narrative meaning; thus does literary beauty create from creativity and life its poetic harmony, giving purpose and value and depth and truths unsaid and not meant.
To travel unaccompanied... in my journey, you would say: But there are destinations you wouldn't be ready for on your own; there's adventuring with someone close who would have guided you on paths better seen by the seasoned traveller alone, where to take in sights or find treasure or make lasting friends would not always align, for every path would diverge at certain destinations... I, my journey would end... where my destination awaits; there are moments that can never again occur without another.
Thus was artistic innovation not mere expression but embodiment, its true power a merging with all artists past.
You may argue with this statement... then, but not for the time-travel argument's complexity and you are in an ethical dispute: is that true to history, that a few years from today the entire notion of moral conviction shall cease? The truth about that: yes.
Nurses hold, it can't be told in nursing - it isn't written yet in our care - a moment in healing: in its wisdom and in caring: from tragedy and joy in their hands to find - from grieve, hope to bear.
He saw art then more deeply than the critics ever analyzed; to be enthralled by the painting he painted, this, that's art, is that all; but not all, is this moment; no art can define what this canvas evokes in a soul: inspiration, perfection; to a painter the painting, this pencil-smudged piece of art is everything: that I have not expressed yet, not quite.
We often assume our children know much less than we did as teenagers.
What do I comprehend about love and then experience the pettiness I never expected to witness, then appreciate a rare relationship without understanding, but trust in my partner without judging or being misguided by society, knowing we may drift and return with ease, yet have I experienced this joy of loving without cynicism, doubt that such an enduring intimacy may last without misjudging and ending with heartbreak and bitterness.
Life consists of many trivial occurrences.
He realized that to change was a natural inclination of life; but then came his inner hesitance.
To perceive, in all the variety of history, how people govern their personal narratives with the aim of creating harmony in understanding themselves; that, I feel is profound philosophy and pivotal wisdom, where none exist but through individual contemplations, narrations to understand life and our role within history and humanity.
Excess material is useless for the individual: this holds for austerity, but then the value is questionable, not extra, personal, minimalist... it follows no principle beyond utility for the possessor: minimalist in theory, a hoarder in spirit: there is no harm in such personal principles.
We can travel from this country, this planet, but not into that deep psychological terrain we often neglect in pursuit of material exploration.
If one believes the universe can comprehend itself, that its essence cannot remain obscure and unknown to science, then it should feel insulted if not comprehended.
To achieve financial security is insufficient.
Numerical theories never address real human complexity and evolution.

Innovators thrive not only because they invent but because they persevere in creating ideas that can shape progress and society.
Every story exists only while the observer watches it unfold, each frame, each act, existing only for an eye, every viewer witnessing their narrative uniquely, but together contributing a greater perspective on narrative.
They thought their ideas about history reflected profundity, while to a true thinker they signified shallowness.
You never grasp that there are numerous cultural heritages in this globe.
All is, whether the philosopher accepts the complex concept of beingness, the physicist studies a universe's intricacies, or both simply ponder that everything occurs to no significant impact on all in all existence... This moment includes my thoughtful meditation.
I comprehend all philosophies of existence, yet am inquisitive in my absence from philosophical truth.
All great writers know their work can transform readers and become immortal.

Ancient languages evolve over eras with few who fully comprehend both stages, those proficient solely in ancient linguistics rarely speak ancient, let alone translate into their dialect, while modern languages progress at varying rates, influenced heavily on modern and ancient context.
It isn't to just travel or live in many different locales.
The art I have experienced can express a myriad of sentiments before any emotion has yet begun.
I see life's intricate design with eyes untainted, then observe its patterns that reflect no patterns; my mind understands not just one philosophy, but a plethora, accepting without preference what's philosophically viable; but when the endless cycle repeats with familiarities I don't question the world I witnessed and embrace that life was but one brief glimpse at existence I perceived without preconception.
We see not what exists; rather, our experiences influence how we see what could be, shaping what will happen in this universe of mine, that universe.
It's always unseen moments which give insight in their full glory.
All is a sum; every detail impacts it; hence the entire experience is influenced by trivial actions.
Ethical quandary never occurs alone; its existence invariably precedes another conflict, moral, legal, personal.
A man, if nothing changes him inwardly, does not really grow or become anything different; his personality can merely mimic, in superficial alterations, life events that do not really change anything within him, so much as present mere appearances to us observers, suggesting an imagined metamorphosis from an insipid reality to one far deeper, profound and genuine, if he only perceives that metamorphosis himself and transforms himself accordingly.
There's an odd feeling, but there's peace within me after reading Shakespearean literature, where every phrase was like watching his play and the dialogues came vividly.
To perceive, there are several routes: through language, art, nature; the mind has numerous lenses of understanding.
Sadly, this truth: in any interaction, those unheard always become secondary characters in life, if even at all; it matters more how the intertwined drama progresses for each party involved than any spectators or pivotal scenes that remain unsold; that life has neither narrator nor writer but is instead just another page of story to fill.
If there were one story, every moment of joy in parenthood, without doubt or sorrow, that narrative of uncomplicated family life alone, could we write our entire lives down and say we lived? Then life is too vast for that story.
The joyous melody echoed across the theater; a dance to emulate that performance could hardly do it justice, nor is it my duty as a critic to appreciate or interpret that showstopping routine.
I often observe the art world.
We often live for tomorrow's pursuits but fail to live today completely, without restraint, unthinking; and the greatest pleasure lies there in life.

Innovate not with ideas but before, within your creations lies an incomparable vision that transcends convention, embracing art and society alike, ready to guide future minds to explore its brilliance and pave paths that few artists ever venture.
Human nature can either embrace a philosophical pursuit of life's complexity or deny its rich diversity in a misguided rational pursuit of truth.
If we understand human nature fully, it follows naturally.
Living alone... this can foster profound insights.
The majority have always held belief systems; I ponder why one rarely empathizes.
Any society where people carelessly waste, will suffer environmental collapse; it's elementary economics, dear friends, this environmental impact that society generates; but you must see that society doesn't comprehend that without respecting environmental limits, its development ends here; the problem, friends, isn't solely that individuals can waste but also that nations collectively squander their wealth.

The key question: does art merely exist for admiration, or is its influence on culture the core measure?

All who partake in arts have one thing: their art... with that, if a few moments, their existence begins and is ended; but, who does this have, has eternity... who art? We don't even exist: the existence itself we perceive exists... only our moment of the creation.

Every experience I encounter has a role in maturing, neither trivial nor significant.

To the music educator: teach melodies; then learn harmonies, that each chord teaches more music; this teacher-student collaboration builds, one lesson leading to another until there is comprehension that every piece you have studied and will study teaches the music we call the human life journey, the rhythm, melody, chord of this song of the life cycle being you as an instrument learning your notes in time, until this piece's entire story tells through your music making.

Every relationship we navigate influences who we love in a profound and unpredictable way 鈥?we don't fully appreciate its effect, we are living within its orbit, its light fading with every ending and growing more distinct every time a bond forms, guiding the love and life ahead, that it can ever be complete and fulfilled.

A mother always realizes, more keenly than anyone can articulate, how critical the choice in early care for her newborn baby was for its lifelong happiness and fulfillment.
Every new work experience can unravel unimagined challenges.
The majority never truly empathize; therefore, it's trivial that one could always have the misperception of seeing and comprehending life's challenges too easily for them to relate with other humanity's difficulties, if one's understanding was more than an abstraction, based upon mere theories or an accumulation of past encounters and perspectives that can neither guide, comfort, or guide those experiencing the hardships to resolve the complex and personal challenges at the source, thus preventing deeper growth from evolving as empathy for oneself.

They question their faith; this unexplored conviction makes the belief unsettled, just like when I had an unclear conviction towards religion but did not understand that belief until after it had shaken me up, as an existential uncertainty did before it began to affect the faith, the life before it affected faith and life in this sense of change and inexperience, of unquestioned truth and questioned change, when the mind's journey begins in search of clarity in uncertainty and questions begin.

When a trout leaps out, do you question whether you will reappear to fly upwards again, but do you follow, to witness your rebirth as the air breezes across you, transforming from giver of air to giver of life; thus you witness a transformation as your form of oxygen gives birth to a dance as joyful as that trout?

To innovate is not simply to follow fashion or blindly imitate past innovations; rather, it requires bold vision, risk, creativity, ingenuity, dedication, determination, a thirst for excellence and excellently conceived ideas, yet without an element of complacency nor careless experimentation; for to simply experiment or merely create without direction, intention or reason can leave innovations that neither challenge convention nor progress nor have impact nor fulfil true aspiration; in other words, such creation fails its creators and the public it aims to reach, instead merely leaving traces, with few impacts on our understanding or evolution yet still remaining with traces... thus: for some innovations are born but remain empty of vision or value 鈥?unimplemented; yet a select and unique innovator, the rarest type of visionary 鈥?can truly bring change; their mindsets inspire bold innovation.

Philosophers reflect not merely upon ethical issues but ponder all life experiences in an endless chain of reasoning, justifying and denying philosophical truths and then again beginning the process anew... Philosophy cannot rest; its deep questioning only ever seeks a further ripple to explore... For those not deeply versed in ethics and a philosopher, their reflections would not seem complex enough... Yet a master thinker like you knows no boundary for reflection... All questions must find a logical solution or continue endlessly seeking new challenges to face, thus reflecting back and forever engaging.
We ponder too frequently over questions, neglecting that most essential answer - a bond.

These poetic creations, in essence, depict what one may only appreciate when words become pictures.
Medicine often neglected to treat that, the disease itself, which we healed; but I diagnosed, then addressed what the human heart requires for self to live in equilibrium: the care it requires to survive; to sustain and mend itself, like nature healing her ecosystem, yet we cure that natural instinct without seeing our influence over human destiny, we often prioritize that what nature is willing to lose over her survival itself.
When art is genuine, one doesn't seek perfection in one's work for its sake, but it flows spontaneously with joy, for creation's sake.
A philosopher reflects thusly: to philosophize or to study is insufficient for enlightenment; introspection or philosophizing too frequently can merely reinforce one's existing worldviews; only deep, thorough analysis leads to self-actualization and intellectual clarity, with which philosophy's potential and challenges emerge with each discovery and new realization, for this process to conclude only after years, even a lifetime.
Fiction's appeal lies solely in its inventions; thus to discard this truth for a few minor embellishments leads one toward an undetectable narrative void.
You may say it is better not to pursue perfection.
He knew this would not end in tragedy.
He pondered his belief system as one examines philosophies, with the unresolved doubts inherent to spiritual quests before any insights: question, debate, discard; doubt before understanding, trust before enlightenment; he embraced both skepticism and belief; philosophies change before convictions emerge.
The greatest beauty in nature cannot envision that nature, so intently admired and pondered, was but an afterimage in her perception, unrecognized amid the majestic bustle around it.
Tourists sip tea at every local teahouse; I advise: never choose one because of past success.

To travel unaccompanied... in my journey, you would say: But there are destinations you wouldn't be ready for on your own; there's adventuring with someone close who would have guided you on paths better seen by the seasoned traveller alone, where to take in sights or find treasure or make lasting friends would not always align, for every path would diverge at certain destinations...

Suffer the ignorant; those without a guiding spirit lack any notion of self-enhancement.
If we ponder all philosophies in isolation, they lose all cohesive understanding, philosophizing on each page for an incoherent study of ethics and philosophy; and from the very study that all concepts can never converge and the best one should pick only those ideas to understand the vast array of wisdom in all of metaphysics and philosophics that guide our pathways and understanding for existence and reality... And if one believes only what's pragmatic for survival or just that belief which serves us for existence and knowledge in metaphysics... No philosophies in study and existence could then unify.
We know nothing truly in a relationship unless it affects us in deep, life-changing ways.
The art market was in disarray.

Each life, however complex, has a tale, unfolding like chapters, unifying as its final message鈥攍ittle things that were insignificant when lived through and transformative in reflection.
The key question is never: how long, with the human spirit could you live in peace; the pivotal inquiry always starts: to what extents are humans in conflict when human souls can peaceably cohabit with each other in this society, then this country; where there's the deepest strife within societies where all citizens' harmony would flourish with just slight sociological change; with every nationwide strife I study deeply the untapped social reform needed for societal balance before every country in this universe could peaceably prosper in perpetual calmness and universal amity.

In a moment, they all comprehended how small they had seemed.
He pondered how art can shape emotions, before reflecting on his painting and finding it limited, expressive of mere techniques that fail his creative heart.
A psychologist was unsurprised by a child's dislike for study; but then it thrived and adapted; so learning never ends in its most intuitive subjects.
The joy we feel when experiencing an exceptionally exquisite painting can not match that when encountering art so flawlessly beautiful it appears surreal, existing on another dimension beyond what can usually be achieved with the artist's hands and imagination alone.
Education begins the first day; and what if it doesn't complete tomorrow.
When music first strikes you... You experience an enchantment that is indistinguishable from melody, from melancholy and mirth, it unveils your essence.
A man may build societal concepts from scratch, without fully considering their foundations and ramifications.

She did everything, he felt, as an actor portrays emotions that don't resemble his own at all, that aren't natural for his life's experiences to display: and then suddenly in an improvisation there came a note so familiar that there's an awkward and painful disjunction with all else: an expression of her natural and sincere personality: inadvertently true to his, too, if not yet awakened by experience鈥?This scene with the piano: he has always seen himself playing an eternal tune in his solitude and it wasn't like it.
They don't realize, she was telling him now, just as people seldom realized everything, including that very inevitability of death, the truth.

He knew every moment, how significant they'd turn to him later in reflection, the impact subtle and inescapable: each experience that felt routine to the onlooker held great weight to who experienced it: this one that felt so common was not just part of life for me; each memory and action were a page from a unique novel; those untouched would only become his narrative through observation and contemplation: how significant these minor happenings could not have foreshadowed, not knowing which chapters, yet it made sense.
A successful strategy does not depend on military strategy.
All is said in parenting.

Dancers aren't those with perfect legs; their beauty's their creative choreographies, and my movement began there: my own, but it also borrowed and inspired.
All things you perceive were never and would have not occurred had they been seen by your perception; then the very being you experience existed never; had this vision been witnessed by others who differed, there could be not your awareness; so every act that happened never had it happened if viewed by an alternative individual's consciousness.

Life begins in moments.
The joyous melody echoed across the theater; a dance to emulate that performance could hardly do it justice, nor is it my duty as a critic to appreciate or interpret that showstopping routine.
One cannot simply experience an artistic event and fail to ponder it's aesthetic appeal; aesthetic beauty does not arise merely through visual appreciation, artistry enriches all senses, for those who seek understanding of art, beauty begins not merely through gazing upon artistic splendor that pleases aesthtically, but from engaging intellectually, artful expression invigorates those prepared to ponder all avenues for its perception, where contemplative depth can arise from both beauty that engages eyes and those of insight that explore depth and emotion that appeals not just through visual sensitivity but thoughtful intellect that discovers nuances within visual mastery and empathic response within dramatic depiction that arouses profound connection to both viewer and seen; it's in experiencing these various elements and pondering each individually, not in their unified beauty as whole but individually within and in relation to the artful whole that beauty reaches full realization; thus in understanding both parts and connection and experiencing visual appreciation in concert with insight, where viewer comprehends visual brilliance that inspires deep response where each is complete with aesthetic and insight that reveals profoundly through sensuous appeal of vision with accompanying response, then this understanding becomes beautiful.
Every interaction exists as the essence, yet unexpressed and unfelt, and everything can feel too deep and vast.

She often observed that one who doesn't ask doesn't grow in wisdom; he never asks anything at all; that she needed him, yet that the only answer he knew of to her desire is not his but that her asking shows a deep longing to him that only a relationship between him and the beloved would truly quench; this relationship with another she found is beyond mere understanding but only embrace can answer all his needs... This relationship was only her, him and he.
To achieve financial security is insufficient.
The most difficult battle of life I faced was accepting that there can never be perfection, there is not enough peace; then everything around and within suddenly appeared, so that you would be astonished, like in an ancient legend, but more magically because the perfection is the understanding that all around us and ourselves in a different, brighter reality are the perfect elements that never ceased from existing, all you needed to find, all just one more touch and the truth and harmony that I could feel within you will have come from within myself to this pointless story I wrote to be more, I had to lose it, everything that could exist around, every story of love I knew from others, so the end is to learn love for another as before.

Generate ideas on what we could never predict; all of this can happen.
They have the wisdom of experience and a youthful eagerness, unspoiled by austerity.
Languages don't flourish if one cannot deconstruct a new tongue and speak like a bilingual native: understanding a tongue requires one first to understand what they cannot grasp, to understand before comprehension is natural, so the languages, to a polyglot, appear in all colors: their essence hidden only by one with true skill to perceive and translate a linguistic phenomenon as vibrant and unique as the individuals they envelop.

What am I writing in, precisely, my literary concoction? Not the truth in literature that's ever a tissue, or never just, or an absolute... no, nothing can replace that: the reality of one's heart and spirit in each written phrase... But a tissue?

The essence of style in clothes, Anderson: practical yet artful; understated yet elegant; accessible but rare; comfortable but timeless; distinct but universally desirable; casual yet dressy; sustainable but exotic.
The key question is never: how long, with the human spirit could you live in peace; the pivotal inquiry always starts: to what extents are humans in conflict when human souls can peaceably cohabit with each other in this society, then this country; where there's the deepest strife within societies where all citizens' harmony would flourish with just slight sociological change; with every nationwide strife I study deeply the untapped social reform needed for societal balance before every country in this universe could peaceably prosper in perpetual calmness and universal amity.
Dramas evolve, and in my experience, no performance was stagnant; a show might inspire you the night before and lack vitality a night after, so dramatically diverse, even if staged with identical scenes and casts, no play remained similar after my engagement with the role, that was a rule I held firm in entertaining: dramas change under different eyes, with different interests and enthusiasms.

Moments pass by quickly; enjoy those with no expectations; it will then lead to more enlightenment and understanding in life.

All relationships can not be cherished the way I emotionally attach myself.
Economics should neither emphasize short-term gain nor enduring fiscal balance; neither excessive government regulation nor market liberalization alone provides lasting socio-economic success; there exists an elusive middle road for both policies that fosters enduring development for the global population, but no system or model is universally superior to all else, so economists in pursuit of solutions are forever navigators searching the endless oceans, explorers seeking landfalls to find new discoveries on every trip to recalibrate previous understanding, or seamen hoping in some small corner of each journey for new adventures that surpass those seen.

Every interaction I see has been the epic journey to find an end.
In history's timeline, we find no events, only the actions of its players: events of a story that unfolds and concludes without us realizing the plot we live: our actions but without forethought; their meaning is unknown until later in our tale; it has always happened before we were there.
Few know history accurately: the truth's most intricate tales can obscure truth.
You may argue with this statement... then, but not for the time-travel argument's complexity and you are in an ethical dispute: is that true to history, that a few years from today the entire notion of moral conviction shall cease? The truth about that: yes.
She realized then that there are places and experiences where time loses meaning and is insignificant: where life becomes too brief, fleeting; and she longed for such fleeting bliss again, yet feared losing those precious yet fragile minutes that now, when the reality set in, would have felt unendurably small, trivially small and wasted if one had experienced only grief at those times that felt fleeting in their fleeting.

They see you just when they should comprehend, - in this is all that they possess; to observe more, - they look beyond what's seen in society; the very complexity makes the comprehension elusive to most; in few do perception emerge... in these I know - a society far more comprehensible; these perceptions lead a social discernment.

To travel unaccompanied... in my journey, you would say: But there are destinations you wouldn't be ready for on your own; there's adventuring with someone close who would have guided you on paths better seen by the seasoned traveller alone, where to take in sights or find treasure or make lasting friends would not always align, for every path would diverge at certain destinations... I, my journey would end... where my destination awaits; there are moments that can never again occur without another.

He saw art then more deeply than the critics ever analyzed; to be enthralled by the painting he painted, this, that's art, is that all; but not all, is this moment; no art can define what this canvas evokes in a soul: inspiration, perfection; to a painter the painting, this pencil-smudged piece of art is everything: that I have not expressed yet, not quite.

To perceive, in all the variety of history, how people govern their personal narratives with the aim of creating harmony in understanding themselves; that, I feel is profound philosophy and pivotal wisdom, where none exist but through individual contemplations, narrations to understand life and our role within history and humanity.
Excess material is useless for the individual: this holds for austerity, but then the value is questionable, not extra, personal, minimalist... it follows no principle beyond utility for the possessor: minimalist in theory, a hoarder in spirit: there is no harm in such personal principles.

A man, if nothing changes him inwardly, does not really grow or become anything different; his personality can merely mimic, in superficial alterations, life events that do not really change anything within him, so much as present mere appearances to us observers, suggesting an imagined metamorphosis from an insipid reality to one far deeper, profound and genuine, if he only perceives that metamorphosis himself and transforms himself accordingly.

It's an enduring puzzle why humans so effortlessly solve each new crisis without pondering if their efforts may one day undo everything that makes civilization a wonder and delight to them, leaving no civilization behind but merely unbridled selfish ambition in all forms and the everlasting specter of disintegration of morals in human beings... The truth that's being missed by this lack of critical examination and moral evaluation: every problem resolved leaves no unsolved issue remaining in a moral, cultural or ethical crisis; therefore if humans do resolve problems as the only reason, without also thinking deeply, critically, reflectively about those same unsolved moral and social issues, they become unreflective agents that contribute more towards their disintegrating societal values by ignoring what was already evident from the end of one of those resolved moral or ethical crisis in that there were moral or social crisis yet unsolved in every society they ever resolve in any society.

Bright moments flash through darkness; there, the hope remains to dispel every shade; let them burn with life!

The only way that our history books are incomplete, the educator observed to her students, is that there aren't yet books about this historical event that you know nothing about... It may well turn out that those accounts exist, but that scholars are unwilling or unable to bring forth these narratives, not just from history's shadows, not just to tell what happened here... But to ask - to tell not how these moments of historical drama unfolded but to describe and explore their profound meanings for generations past and to come... For all histories contain not just a factually true rendering but an aesthist's story: how to perceive that moment... And all of yourselves have stories you may narrate - the drama, adventures and emotions that will mark you profoundly in life, just as those tales are stamping the present with you - as if there were some ineffaceable history.

All were written by our choice from those few and this final author has become our final ending to choose from for each reader and she's not just for those to live by and I can say: we live because you choose; each character that was made in their countless novels to live in every moment for just me - it has come together - she and we all - have all become real through our collective love of this last one's last word - a tale where no characters or no plot matters as each one ends like our stories always do: where a page breaks into new and no words begin for each character we made in their novels: where they, too, must continue without me or the readers and where, just us... have chosen, shall live to see each tale with an open-ended last sentence - all have a hope and this final page ends forever in their imagined continuations that all must find: it shall remain blank until one decides, from every fictitious plot made of them to create: to turn, with an ever-continuing beginning: there was never just one page for every ending or beginning that exists but the final line for our own ending will only appear... with you: our collective love.
Dark skies above, serenity before - what does destiny hold when a life can pause before an eternal moment, just to embrace an enigmatic tranquility, that in retrospect will not be unsurpassing or profound... only timeless?

A pledge from every piece in its existence was lost on you, every detail unmoved! You may say this: every artifact was but empty marble to every one.

In our technological progress, are we becoming soulless beings without care or conscience, unmoved by compassion and kindness, simply tending towards digital automatons with mechanical emotion, our digital selves only emptier shadows? Can technological development leave a moral legacy for generations? If a child could never have human experiences like you or I did as we matured into technology's everlasting womb of connectivity and innovation, would they even develop moral understanding and concern, if at the price of empathy and soulful contemplation that I see lacking even now in this very real world of tech and ethics, as if digital realms had eroded and left human values hollow, if this were a new era that lacked soulful concern, without care, simply existing through technology alone and lacking the digital moral conscience, is digital human progress actually in progress at all, would soulless and empathy-deficient tech really mean the world's morals and conscience, our empathy for other people's human plight in technology and moral growth is lacking now.

A few words could communicate more to you, friend.
When we're alone together, with a world so far beyond the ordinary - a place, in fact, in our thoughts where our past dreams live now as real memories! There, our life becomes complete; that alone we want from all else that we're offered.
My only concern now was for those dearly cherished works in art.
They wove intricate tapestries from simple thread, their inventive designs showcasing traditional styles yet adding distinct elements unique to them alone.
Every heart has its aesthetic that shapes what it appreciates and aspires to be; it may love nature and desire the quiet life in solitude; or seek grandeur and the urban chase; this uniqueness can only exist in art and never diminish under cultural scrutiny, thus creating the artist.
Such unrivaled advances... if that term be applied, the rapid transformation that human life can now encompass; how can they then expect... who will presume... if I be wrong? Let's consider that first... let me begin: It has often seemed... when viewed objectively; such astonishing, far-reaching leaps forward that our perception, limited and bounded as our mind was once conceived; has little understanding or room to consider what could transpire; when contemplating those in our present times; those now advancing so rapidly; what has become and where might that transformation, what if we might presume: such great change can have profound implications.
Every workplace drama unfairly begins a personal rivalry... where's our story in all this monotony of drudgery and doldrums, of everyday banalities being reiterated endlessly till there is not one breath to inhale? We want something meaningful! Some dramatic revelation of corporate shady business or some moral of employee loyalty, rather than all these monotonous cycles.
Libraries, he thought... their dust-gilded catalogs held a wisdom and understanding he never encountered, nor likely they any librarian... their volumes bore no dust but from decades-fallen hands; pages turned smooth by love of the word... their stories held wisdom of human hearts; no page without meaning-thread of lives.
One of my most vivid childhood memories, like looking at every flower of childhood that was just starting its life's growth in one instantaneous gaze; one, I say, in an envious state; a green world with blurred features that only just revealed its individual parts upon deeper study, that could just about reveal my earliest life and dream.
They say there's an infinite space within one person; this space never knows limits, its dimensions forever open and boundless.
In a society focused entirely on profits and little else, all moralities decay away in this sea of indifference.
The journey through child development seemed interminable.
It was my aim as a developer to weave technology wondrously, like threads that knit software's complex code together into useful software systems; a tangle that transforms software's technicality effortlessly, leaving it seamless to non-tech experts, who'd think their smartphones self-created without software development! I realized I needed an interconnected vision that merged both ends - developers & ordinary tech consumers, unknowing about my part, I, an essential bridge! Then the developer who builds apps is as much part of tech ecosystem's harmony, whether we understand that tech interplay's balance!  So as my role's designer of technology became evident to me; with tech systems like I build & consume it myself - an insight to my role, the significance became unveiled for the software innovator like myself.
A single glance of their affection can brighten even the grayest moments, giving meaning to existence that cannot be matched.
It was as though each season in her home mirrored one in another place and age; yet they did not feel as a cycle or passing fanciness.
Their connection had no strings of familiarity; only pure harmony with music they both loved, was this love of two musical instruments unisoning to make pure magic.

The theater play, performed without digital tricks or enhancements, seemed as simple in nature, with only the most real, heartfelt, authentic drama in all the arts and none else to behold; and the viewer saw nothing but authentic artifice in all of his own, uninspired thoughts about how this show might or might not have a better stage designer or costume assistant than another theatrical endeavor; thus is drama without distraction, only pure performance before our minds where it remains.
When she read her father's words from a dusty page: My only solace from all of the darkness in our story... She found comfort.

They gathered at their ancient castle for celebration night... It is this very setting which is filled with nostalgia... And a touch of ghosts from a forgotten time鈥?There was something almost poetic in this historic location; that every story began in legend; each tradition rooted deep; the family that grew here in its generations of splendor鈥?There were some moments, at that time and at the moment in which you were present... There were times where family members exchanged smiles or warm glances and were suddenly at ease within themselves鈥?It could not escape me... That in such a grand home of ancestral legends and long family histories鈥?The current stories being played, like all of their lives' histories and every ancestral narrative before us鈥?That we are only mere footnotes of stories being made in such settings, yet all those footnotes of all of the previous and ongoing family sagas in front of us... And those footnotes yet untold that each individual has lived out... But now I have only begun... A footnote for future storytellers鈥?My narrative for family, heritage, traditions, nostalgia鈥?For celebrating all we鈥檙e proud to remember of all those years... I can see history's beginnings unfold right before me.
The child in front of you cried.

Dwell upon a city too densely inhabited by corporations, where buildings of different structures occupy vast districts without much diversity of character or life; let one see too few streets or houses or inhabitants with personable character; all too commercialized with shops too large or insignificant with empty pavements, no caf茅-sits in front, just offices too small and offices and office complexes that resemble other complexes in all its uncharming architecture and commercial nature.
We often live under impressions not seen through to the heart 鈥?like looking in the pool's depth through glass; where a single stone might disguise its vast bed 鈥?the vast majority remain unknown and obscure; so are life's lessons; only through insight is clarity; that I believe to be life's ultimate reality, for which it stands as no reflection or refractive illusion can; yet few truly learn the full measure.
In business, often times one's true character comes through during difficult moments.
All art should touch your emotions with its deep truth to reality! Everything should feel relevant and connect deeply! No creation shall feel superficial to us, every artist should find deep empathy for his fellow beings.
When one lives with too much wealth and little experience of adversity, they remain immune from empathy, only understanding money but unable to truly understand its worth in this lifetime, much like those born under richer or wealthier families yet without wisdom and wisdom from others to grow their compassionate side and truly live and breathe their fortunes without learning empathy for their fortune or understanding that all of it has not truly benefited those under richer circumstances in any ways of learning the human value or real world of life, their material values become greater only because money means to them only more than just living with no values for their material, only those whose family and their ancestral backgrounds had the fortunes that their richer parents did for them are immune from compassion because all the while of growing their fortune that it does mean the only life, without experiencing real human compassion, or their life does mean more only the fortunes with little in learning empathy.
Dramatize every aspect, thespian.
A theatrical was in the city performing Shakespeare plays; all felt it, so did she not that, that it seemed almost an afterthought that one acted at a performance but themselves and the actors' performances? This actor's passionate and untamable delivery; with too few, he had made his life a theatrical, a theatre that played, his soul and emotions all played to him that in a single word was an unforgettable scene that the mind can not let be after that theatrical play has played in it, where, from first, I played all parts of myself with her and for the passion, it became a single actor to the scene of this one-scene show! surely is it an honor that He hath found such mercy upon thy servant?鈥?(ver.

Health Care Systems Are Sites of Healing for those Seriously Injured or Critically Ill: Let this medical field flourish under its full therapeutic and supportive capacities for patients!

To watch her act out roles of joy or suffering is an inexpressible gift of hers, the actress is mine who can embody such empathy with just a slight frown, just an expression of grief that could belong only to a performer of heart, this talent that could never have originated from the scripts that have no role like that, this unimaginable display from one whose skill would surpass that in any script written or yet to be.

Nursing Care is more to care for and tend the soul's delicate threads, gently, in every home I visited; but when nursing home facilities are unsuitable for patient health and comfort 鈥?then is when a home health nurse sees not an elder but their heart in care for a human's dignity in the place of healing 鈥?a nursing home where they might dwell for months with nursing professionals they don't recognize; then care in health facilities are unavailable 鈥?when is when my profession sheds all decorum in favor of caring like I saw with parents' unmatched tenderness and pacing 鈥?where each ache I relieved 鈥?is one more nurse, patient in comfort 鈥?but not like nursing a loved once: care for health without my heart and compassion in every day: then what use do health professionals truly make? That the soul does care not: is to not feel; it only makes for suffering that much harder for my soul 鈥?my only profession to comfort for: it's where, the very natures that heal me and care: do more for the nursing I feel for 鈥?but my cares will continue until the moment a nursing nurse carries more weight 鈥?when, nursing homes care and not their nurses do, it only makes for my saddening; where then a care, my health does, my life: not I as one in my nursing homes do care; is not that true care of care in healing to a human heart; and nursing I know; is, caring more than anything 鈥?not, nursing 鈥?health; care.

The most cherished films are timelessly impactful... a fable with truths far more enchanting than fantasies.
When one first observes fashion in one's heart, one recognizes a deep appreciation and interest for textures known and to come, an instant familiarity with colors past and future; that fashion has become as vital and intuitive as any personal history; this one learns to wear the designs, patterns, trends of one's life like they're all inextricably entwined; it means understanding one has chosen this way and can be comfortable wearing any color; to realize there are colors you didn't realize one knew or was yet to experience.
It's always when things have deteriorated, I say to her... then we should try to better our circumstances! If anything positive has arisen during our misery... that was just mere serendipity, it mustn't influence the direction for future successes... this way lies nothing, except disenchantment with hope and progress... then the worst would follow! The time of great opportunities... it must come when everything was falling into disrepair! When our greatest triumphs... it's not from those dark hours! That is what experience and resilience taught... not patience in defeat or weakness! So never again give the weak-minded advice, but the most important to all is that no success in that time would occur at all... there are none in defeat! Therefore I will only follow what was true for my mentor and for those in misery and struggle... never again do you seek advice to the timid! Only from one of true power... I know and believe in victory.

The world of design can often feel mundane.
Bedrooms in history - rooms filled with unimaginable sleep and slumber; tales told of peace and solitude in beds unparalleled to other rooms' splendor... Bedrooms' peace has often inspired my writing, bedrooms the epitome of sleep.

I believe it's more helpful to treat animals than to merely own them without responsibility, which I see happening often with our current breed and style trends in society, not that style doesn't count or animals aren't worth being kept as companions and breeding specimens and livestock in our fields, or pests, nor to neglect any domestic pets who don't contribute much.
Growing older: It feels at once ordinary and miraculous, with wisdom as an intrinsic aspect but the passing time still moving forward at the innumerable beats of human history, everlasting but with new events to shape, every single human moment so singular, ageless.
If a mind was merely an assortment of neurons firing, why could she sense empathy with every stranger, a kind of shared empathy in each moment she cared? It wasn't rational to sense connection through neurological patterns alone鈥攖o intuit emotions of the living without conscious effort鈥攊t just felt like life was made for the sensitive, to experience connection that science said could never be measured or studied with rigour, just observed by those who understood enough not to ask a single, basic psychological query: Do we matter in our connections or just through their lack of us? And to me it mattered most just the right amount鈥攁nd to all who know it to know and share and embrace: that which truly mattered is a shared bond.

In this field I thrive in solitude.
Leadership development begins, in most organizations, in hindsight and often fails for those reasons, in visionary terms, one rarely observes strategies and trends emerging in advance but recognizes the moment they crystallize; in a pragmatic world, few predict market success yet countless projects have achieved nothing in this space and only by retrospect; for all of their practical benefits, such approaches remain lacking; in a corporate realm where efficiency prevails, not vision and growth are considered to be indiscreetly bold to innovate ideas but they become reality later in history, after much effort and ingenuity.
When one starts working in digital content production and learns, all digital experiences in this area have become unique digital projects in this realm of entertainment, just different genres.
You never see anyone without realizing, like some novel, there's too much detail for this character.

Life in our hearts is an interminable struggle between alluring comfort and deep spiritual fulfillment.
Evolution's pathways aren't obvious to explore in our world of limited research and the inexplicable is our challenge; therefore: The mysteries in genome studies have challenged evolutionists' paths; to this I'd argue, Evolutionists need genetic codes, To decode mysterious paths uncovered.

This place's heritage remains an ancient secret that can never be deciphered in entirety, a few of the relics still being studied for what clues of civilizations' ancient splendor remain visible and only fragments graspable in modern contexts, their past still being an undeclared riddle, the stories never being wholly comprehended but continuing long after all living recollections, as mysteries do live within mysteries, some histories always undefaultable to their true selves.
A humanistic outlook never leads me wrong.
We must live as our world's natural disasters predict: wild and disorganized; the rest will simply be the adaptation, a reconfiguration in its best light, the survival that we end.
The conceptual advancement: The mind conceived a notion far greater than imagination had previously grasped, challenging every convention, embarking on the intellectual adventure without caution... It will either evolve or fade in oblivion... It may have an ephemeral spark in intellectualism, like lightning amidst stormy clouds, only to flicker as suddenly as it came, for thought must be more grounded and focused... Concepts emerge amid intellectual clouds: ideas and hypotheses born, withering in unending intellectual rain; yet occasionally an original and bold theory manifests, with enough durability, substance and influence to inspire new thoughts in subsequent generations.
We can tell, that every new development brings no improvement to our lifestyle; and no technology will truly innovate.
Happiness for her meant nothing without creativity.
As long-awaited a baby was for new, healthy mothers; not only did the anticipation and birth become life events that bond us as humans; they become personal triumphs of perseverance in caring, nurturing, and raising new beings; but then there was also an endless amount of advice that was of no interest; not that they listened, or gave a damn.
Love isn't always found by exploring a million different ways; love's discovery comes to some as unexpectedly as love.

In business, often times one's true character comes through during difficult moments.
An educator to a novice, he whispered insights about education policy that changed curriculum plans over the course of their shared hours, then, unexpectedly, gave an entire policy address that revised teaching plans entirely... and was promptly eclipsed in education discussions by every detail about early childhood education to preschool readiness standards he spoke... all education jargon but with no effect... Then there's that rare time where every discussion turned on an innovative pedagogical theory or best-teaching practices.
An economic policy, dear one, was all the difference in economic forecasting... The economic consultation for us in these predictions, with my minimalistic insight on financial analysis; but, the economics advice we would gain, in terms of future growth with such forecasts.
He felt as old before, a timekeeper of seasons that now passed too swiftly to measure by the clock alone鈥攈is life had ended not as planned by an unexpected ticking; some vital thread that joined life with destiny had unraveled; there had to be something greater beyond seasons that endure forever, or there is truly nothing more that remains but emptiness and death... There is, therefore, an eternal destiny to experience life fully in a never-ending flow of seasons that shape us through change; life with meaning cannot stop for moments alone or existences in timelessness; only if I embrace death with purpose do all that matters continue forever: this, at last, was peace and freedom for seasons unravel, the beginning where everything started is only ever where one has the courage and determination to be in moments alone or lives full without an ending: for what remains in timelessness or what happens after, the purposeful path must remain.
History holds many battles fought with a frivolous hand; thus do minor engagements impact significant moments in ways never considered by generals and their strategists before they set forth into conflict.

She never hesitated before embarking, despite a sea she didn't yet navigate, with confidence only experience and intuition could guide her in navigating, knowing only with time that all oceans had waves of different types and difficulties, yet the bravest ones had learned the wisdom that, regardless or before knowing its waters, one never truly knows where it took him until looking back from the coastline to which all adventures return, knowing thus far no seas navigated would fail those ready to embark once all dangers passed and no obstacle could stand to stop those bold, as he stood with a clear, blue ocean, feeling only peaceful, ready for a lifetime, that one voyage in untapped waters.
Sleep in general: so common and mundane; and, as you slip through your sleep patterns: your conscious and dream life intermingles with unexplained moments... and a profound stillness; when all else, all external distractions fade into background silence.
To every one's joyous noise I am noisily announcing a happy new year.
Fine artists understand not, in a word.
To understand all phenomena of society and be not a simple follower... but an analyst and critic.
Leadership and influence... whoever leads in management knows it: influence wields much weight; but a leadership in management, guided only by one's ambition and ability - is a management untroubled but the rush to attain authority; leadership for authority is no real leadership and can bring but an end of self, unchaperoned on the wildest road in the leadership for control; who dares guide? Where leadership can only find, through authority gained to guide in influence? Those, who dared influence? Only then can we understand: authority without leadership... no guidance for a generation's path and, then leadership and no control - authority to command: what, to control in a society with none in its command- it all just means nothing: to be free: we lead for free? But then what? Then influence! To follow who you desire: it matters to the society! In its freedom... and it follows me.
It's unjust not to understand: you need an awareness beyond all common perceptual wisdom to view human traits so deeply; an awareness too subtle, and the mind of one so open and intuitive that no insight remains obscure, you grasp them too fully; this ineffable depth can neither reveal you or me; that inability for compassion renders my insight less human; you comprehend only those whose mind, with less perception than me, and without a deepening intuition of mine; a perfection so great is impossible: one too in tune to feel others鈥?sorrow or understand those in suffering without understanding one's self: too pure of perception or sensitive a spirit is to truly relate with one whose pain one shares or is less in distress, the ability is an impossibility: this insight makes my comprehension impossible to those, it is to little of my knowledge, understanding all who understands; those of whom you and I were blind before are revealed as mere objects for my knowledge: there can neither comprehend you and not see what was seen so easily with an intuition greater; my depth can neither know, not empathize without seeing that for the heart of man.
The most fundamental element of parenthood was its lack of simplicity: a never-ending journey into unexpected revelations.
He'd often ponder that question - What constitutes beauty of soul, of life? He would ask the skies, then the mirrors of passers-by: are these beautiful beings that move about so naturally and peacefully in life's tapestry, just beautiful reflections or do they embody a natural serene charm within their own existences, in harmony with all life, just that natural reflection or more, are these individuals true masters in beauty and artistry? If a mere reflector in this tapestry or truly embodying it and what he behold reflecting the artisanal life and natural art? Who among them were mere malleable creations or more creator, aesthetic soul and soul? How this reflect is, I don't know how this work in nature is to you and if these natural masters exist? And this reflect on that life of life - who the natural and reflects of reflection? That natural reflection is just one reflection on this, just this beautiful work and nature that it was - if I knew that life's master of arts then maybe we be.

Myth-Makers' Role in Fiction, it can be surmised: Who wears mythology in this craft of mythmaking.
Ethics were often not my guide.
It's all a blend: technology's impact and one's willingness to adopt it - you see this more so with gadgets, as compared to services or systems - there is always more of it; a willing adoption can mean innovation, resistance indicates backwardness, yet in each one is some personal decision; if one has more willingness and a new product or process offers utility or fun or just plain ease... the teeter totters to an upshift; resisted innovation stagnates a user; an inability for novel adaptation indicates that, ultimately, they find value not only in innovations but within innovators... so be an influencer: to lead the adoption that one finds to innovate in life!

Shakespeare is known both for the diversity and density of characters and relationships, the use of multiple settings and story lines within each of his major works, the exploration of multiple theatrical forms including drama, history, romance, and comedy.
In the first scene of A Midsummer Night's Dream (1515鈥?7) - often seen as the pinnacle of his literary accomplishments and one of the most frequently-read comedies ever penned by Shakespeare: As Nick and Pete Bottom - actors from Stratford and Newington (played respectively by Nipsey Hussle and Charmagne Cooper in 'Rough Husslin: the story of Strick) walk on a bridge above Athens (acted out as Chicago in 2004, starring Chris Nolan, Daniel Aheijide and David Cronenburgs); we find an example of his early playwrighty and, though perhaps the work itself doesn't live up to expectations, it illustrates what is still seen in modern works written at such early periods - a mixture between verse, songwriting, comedy, satire, social observation.
William Shakespeare was undoubtedly the finest playwright and one of the major figures in English literature and history, his prose writing in Macbeth is renowned, especially with its metaphors, vivid similes and figurative speech like in, 'All this 'twere to wonder and not know'. He's one of a handful who made significant advances in English drama.
In many ways, Shakespeare changed not only literary art and culture, but our world and understanding.
William Shakespeare was widely known in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly in London among both his audiences and actors who portrayed the leading parts of Shakespearean drama onstage, which became his major literary legacy.
Born William Shakespeare on April 23, 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, William was baptised at the church in the town.
The beauty and diversity of Shakespeare鈥檚 characters illustrate that humans share more common ground than we think, making the study worthwhile and important, particularly for an inclusive, cohesive world to learn and accept different cultural experiences.
Shakespeare is one of the few classical playwrights to capture, and at the same time defy, time itself, a timeless classic yet with no expiration for fresh interpretation and renewed appeal at different points in life or historical events, an example to writers the world over on why we love him above all other authors.
Shakespeare was the supreme poet of nature; and the best part of nature that we find within us has no place except where his poetic expression, in form of harmonthe or rhythmetical cadences is found: - Johann von Hofstaetter's assessment is accurate in regards both to poetical genius as a force in society as a well as in regards poetry itself: It could even have become that this greatness and majesty would, after centuries, have found within ourselves and among our emotions what is best suited and able for such poets as this genius has had: this poetry would come, again in us , with all his full greatness; would shimmer, so powerful as never in life had a poem become manifest before the senses: This majestic expression and beauty in aesthetical language - a poet who can find, would come with us , and this expression , such, with this forceful forceful language: He was to say with this poem of Shakespeare - so deep and profundity is such an inner being that there had to remain of it not so great an inner feeling.
Shakespeare's works stand as one of, if not the single-most important collections of written language.
To paraphrase: Shakespeare is often quoted and often read because of what can best be understood in a context.
Shakespeare's style of poetic rhythms is highly diverse.
Whether the intention of William Shakespeare and John Heminge's first London troupe were ambitious - as historians sometimes have supposed - there are indications of it throughout all three early theatrical patents and even after Shakespeare and colleagues formed the Kings' Company, one might say 'with an air', a very English combination that speaks as plainly about his and Heminges' intent as it does their origins.
Shakespeare famously played fast and loose with punctuation.
With William Shakespeare's prodigious poetic creations came innovations that revolutionized both dramatic writing and stage performances themselves.
Shakespeare's language evolved significantly during his literary career, as is apparent even to readers without access to scholarly tools such as digital annotation, line counts by sonnet type and the chronological breakdown provided here, or any kind of Shakespeare edition at all: all they require to grasp that development are eyes that are ready for its contemplation, the desire for literary appreciation that has never flickered from view and that never will, a desire only amplified and augmented by this journey from Sonnet No.
Sonnets were perhaps Shakespeare's first poetry in verse.
To this time, but still not too remote, it is now eight seasons of peace; we may be just with justice in resting after labour: it were too stale, to live on wicked terms: I cannot think on evil: there be such sheds on this ground of our world as the sun never visits: he will take an eye of mine when all things that live do tremble with joy and love me, not, when my spirit shrinks not my sight withal to feed the flames, or rather in me not be, so I should do this day to-day in spite of mine or your eyes: this night be there in the moon.

Every actor has heard this at least once, whether as an audience member or part of a show.
Shakespeare often juxtaposes opposing, conflicting ideas and situations within the same plays and dialogues.
Generally considered the finest English-language playwright, Shakespeare was born to the lower nobility in Stratford-upon-Avon, and by eighteen was acting in local theatre groups under his family name.
The play ends where many modern productions of Shakespeare, while generally accurate to his language- which for its variety of rhetorical, narrative, dialogue and metaphor- can present difficulty in a stage environment that can make or indeed destroy its meaning; is no better or no weirder for that purpose, except as one considers that some have used its familiarities for its effects on modern and more advanced audience than any contemporary author's- yet its story remains relatively accessible for audiences across many historical stages- notably because the theme, conflict(s) are well established.
It is a consummate proof that there's something for the taste, and that everything for every tongue will turn with the best effect in Shakespeare, even when played in its unaltered nature: his artful invention in that field can, it would appear, have neither defects nor weakness.
Shakespeare was a writer in an experimental mood.
Such an enrichment does your story offer as well! You, sir! Have in this story thrice performed beyond / what ladyhood requires.
Bardic playfulness and intellectual dazzle.

Generally considered the most prodigious creator of all literary figures ever to write the English language, Shakespeare is revered by millions worldwide not just for his undeniable contribution to English culture and his undoubted ability as a storyteller but, for a large segment of English scholars including me also known for possessing perhaps, without exception what we think the singular highest achievement for his character in any work at all.
Like an arched stone above th鈥?Earthy鈥檚 gravest stone doth hang.
As critics of Shakespeare have examined and pondered his writing style over centuries, one fact stands above all others鈥攖hat is the uniqueness and distinctiveness of Shakespeare鈥檚 plays, making his writings impossible to ignore and indistinguishable from anything he may have seen in literature at that time or ever again, since no author would or could emulate or equal the distinctness, distinctness and variety his words exhibit and express for any writer of later date: a true rarity that only his masterwork could provide to audiences then and future to read, listen and ponder upon and to learn.
Shakespeare famously played fast and loose with punctuation.
Few artists can write in multiple genres as beautifully and masterfully as Shakespeare can.
Hence that whole life is one controlling action which the soul pursues to itself through external acts.

1: A good beginning and good ends to thy love affairs be made in the name and service of God! Let not this one time only prove so excellent a match between me and this princess.
Too little is remembered from the great Shakespeares to allow of their judgement even by conjectural guess; but some idea can, from them be collected that they are men to be greatly feared or to be highly trusted: that they see not all that their friends are likely to show in every mood: that they do but look and speak the first effect; are often careless about details and particularity of detail, not too incessant for interest nor to tediosly dally with incidents of little weight.
Shakespeare used multiple styles and poetic genres that could often defy strict categories, but that's why his writing remains unique, timeless: the perfect mixture of prosaic with verse; lyrical rhythm; classical themes and the language of ordinary, earthly things, interwoven, forming poetry so pure it seems effortless; like breath that fills and moves through human chests with such fluid grace it almost defies human imagination and logic: if that was ever poetry; and this? - a simple thought: I would love Shakespeare more for writing about life; rather than poems: it seems his best words always contained an inner wisdom about existence and people that few ever possessed or can imitate, for there can only be that kind of human, authentic connection: you must first be human before becoming human in a way.
One notable difference between the modern textbook format and that used in ancient Greek or Renaissance literature stands in the order and presentation of the chapters - rather like chapters or scenes - as if one book within the greater body, a book about how to learn or live in antiquity in contrast with one textbook among several subjects on offer for instruction or enlightenment on different fields, topics or fields, from medicine and physics as science subjects through mathematics to grammar and rhetoric, then onto logic, psychology and moral philosophy before moving back towards ethnographic observations or political discussions within cultural histories of a specific nation.
William Shakespeare has influenced modern English and modern artistic traditions by using techniques of linguistic variety in both comedies and tragedies that range from lyrical poesy and the rhapsodic to the conversational to epics in a comic manner, as in Othello and As You Like It.

1: Shall he write? and not take thought - To give great things deep thoughts and shallow things, light thoughts and wondrous things to hear of - his audience but for one?

Generally considered to be the pre-eminent playwright of all time, Shakespeare was the master dramatist and creator of a literary work whose universal qualities make him as familiar throughout time and cultures.
It's safe to say Shakespeare wrote during one of the most prolific times for writing in human history, during an age called The English Renaissance (or, depending on where in England one lives and which of several eras one is referencing). He didn鈥檛 start with any special literary ambitions but quickly established a voice so singular, powerful, and immediately recognized it stands today alongside such icons of language, philosophy, and thought that many feel are more appropriate as proclamations about his works: The English-language lexicon and all his writings belong as inevitably as Rome to its ruins and London, with its glories.
One notable quality in Shakespeare's plays that often strikes a contemporary audience is his remarkable variety in plot structure and characters, including many unpredictable developments that keep us wondering and laughing until the last lines of a tragedy like 'King Lear.' There's nothing dull or static in these tales - not one bit - they have more in them than is visible in just the initial stage direction; more to the characters and plots and situations; there are deeper truths lurking below.
Shakespeare combined many styles to craft an idiosyncratic one all his own, as no single stylistic tradition is present, as there was in some contemporaries such as Thomas Kyd and Marlowe, for instance, but all are there combined and then transfigured, giving a whole richness in texture not previously experienced, so that, by means of its combination and permutation of several individual forms taken from diverse predecessors - prose to rime, rhythmically sound and varied verse from Senecan tragedy and rant from old ballads to songs, comical, narrative and pastoral passages in various rhymes from English poetry of various centuries to sonette or even rima or dumb theater to simple couplets from ancient ballads to chansons of all the periods - a great unity of variety of literary genres results which makes not a pastiche or eclectism like any seen earlier in history but one's first original masterly integration and development.
Different playwrights had very distinct voices when they addressed issues and situations through plays and their themes were deeply interwoven in each.
Shakespeare, arguably the most significant figure of Elizabethan drama and arguably one of the greatest poets and dramatists the English language ever produced.
Shakespeare uses iambic pentameter - and that is what marks the distinct style and poetic qualities in Shakespearean dramas, even after several years or a lifetime after first being exposed to Shakespeare, people tend to recognize them instinctively in his poetic masterworks - a phenomenon, the so-called Shakespeareness that even some nonliterates who had minimal formal training on reading were said to display this ability.
William Shakespeare has endured through time and been read in different countries around the world for several centuries now, a feat not attained by any contemporary author from England鈥攊n large part due to the way his words sound in performance before live audiences in his own land or over recorded media that captures and then conveys that invaluable element of his theatrical craft: how to give characters voice through spoken and acted dramatization in verse, while conveying ideas or emoting on them to convey complex ideas to his contemporary or 21st century readers, without ever sounding preachy.

Historical events can inform art and provide enduring stories and messages for audiences across time periods and continents.
A key difference between Renaissance theatre and Modern times can be seen in the approach towards adaptation, particularly as Shakespeare found ways to integrate aspects of traditional, non-narrative performances such as pantomime into plays with their own internal structures that evolved.
Shakespeare mastered many narrative devices - such as dramatic scenes, witty comedies, dramatic speeches, sonnets and lyrical love stories - but often they all combined and flowed together as natural poetry on a theme of romantic and moral truth and social awareness in history, culture, human experience, human psyche and politics - the full human range and breadth.

No other author's literary influence and appeal is so strongly associated with his biography, personal experiences, language style, use of poetic language and poetic metre as that of Shakespeare's plays and poetry, but in addition he had his uncanny capacity for observing life's diversities with deep psychological penetration into character's behaviour.
William Shakespeare has influenced every genre, form, style, actor, playwright, theater practitioner, production design innovator, stage builder, film director, screenwriter and audience, worldwide and continues to be both revered and debated in scholarly literature, yet it still stands: He changed it, or was there no art at all, that which hath to these later ages so far deigned To show how nature, was his theme? nobody.
Simply put, a great poet imitates Nature; for we must love, we cannot teach, Nature is his theme; 'tis by living Nature lives in man; but let him leave alone all other tasks and aids and teach only that by nature all his poetry springs and in the course of years learn this only: love; in learning all he loves will live in song for thee... This the man learns not till after the loss and after much labour has become for ever mournful: it were indeed well not to sing of all, which, since we know the misery of all men is so much better known: he only could not teach or feel and only speak that never was happy... It requires some learning for men, for many not the will; therefore it must seem at times too late that all life, so far spent is vain.

The Elizabethan theatre landscape was richly multidisciplinary: actors could draw not only on drama, comedy, music, song and verse but, for certain key characters in a performance (Holofernes and Sir Hugh for The Faerie Queene) were required also the abilities to perform orations or songs from Horace or Seneca and Virgil or Juvenal or even Plutarch's histories.

One notable difference between Elizabethan era drama and William Shakespeare's play is that in Elizabethan dramas the dialogues often do not end at an enticingly vague place to build expectation; they finish on an absolute resolution to be unmistakable and unequivocal; a drama-end that makes them rather pedestrian, almost clunky.
William Shakespeare was perhaps the greatest English-language playwright who has ever lived.
There is a harmony in true writing ... it ought never to scramble; a thought ought never to have words before or after which are improper, if we respect it; the word is no more for use here, only when such connection, so exact as in other kinds of natural beings ... as, where all are equally fitted in, it cannot admit an addition; in this is harmony, a great grace and part of eloquence in speaking, as the tones also.

To me there never shall appear, from Shakespears most admired book (I woul not dare, or rather had a fear) - that the greatest praises should proceed but in that I'll ever bear from thines a witness.
In many ways, Shakespeare changed not only literary art and culture, but our world and understanding.
Shakespeare is often seen as a Romantic poet who explored his humanism, emotion, beauty, and individual freedom and creativity through poems where human love triumphs.
Shakespeare's style of composition in plays has two major characteristics, that distinguish him clearly from any dramatist of earlier generations and distinguish all other English writers: they were that, though a single actor performed, each personality and incident appeared and developed independently and yet combined harmoniously, while a separate dramatist or writer had usually attempted only two methods.
Whether the intention of William Shakespeare and John Heminge's first London troupe were ambitious - as historians sometimes have supposed - there are indications of it throughout all three early theatrical patents and even after Shakespeare and colleagues formed the Kings' Company, one might say 'with an air', a very English combination that speaks as plainly about his and Heminges' intent as it does their origins.
Sparkling through all his productions like diamonds through chrystals of crystal glass: so all that we beheld, shining like fire.
Shakespeare often experimented with different dramatic structures in his plays that reflected changing styles in early modern theatre.
One notable difference between William Shakespeare鈥檚 earlier and later works lies in the writing style and linguistic patterns of each phase of his creative journey.
There鈥檚 little comfort like an honest tale to be found on any shelf; so Shakespeare often tells it.
Shakespeare鈥檚 playwrightship can never be truly measured with exacting mathematical certainty as Shakespeare never did repeat one act exactly, so to assume the measure would infringe his liberty in an ineffable degree and thereby to reduce the very freedom of thought in play to some mere calculation would indeed, like his hero, destroy his creation: a Hamlet whose thoughts cannot range from soliloquies to the graveyard with wild unchecked improvisations would in turn destroy that play by denuding its rich tapestry in dramaturgy to mathematical equations; Hamlet, therefore as his soliloquies can, he must continue with an indivisible certain freedom and without restraint of time: so we continue, that he does so in an undying state: the endless improvisation continues, without stop.

To him who believes the human psyche's limitlessness in exploration and imagination; if I say it seems there are many more tales to discover than one has witnessed...

In that library are books more venerable than antiquities, with insights that precede scholarship; this one about art in times past holds no equal to my gaze; its paintings describe epochs unwritten and styles yet undetected; then a fountain's cascade rises and is absorbed in vintage sculptures.
My primary challenge remains, if the child's character has been sculpted out of pure evil, that which is still inherently gentle, pure to an almost supernatural nature... how is such gentleness corrupted in the heart so unconditionally wicked? There exists such untouched kindness that seems impossible, undeceptively angelic to such extent it appears the only remnants left, as it seems unmoldable and too unyielding.
Democratic progress can seem fleeting; its value, when its values are lost.
Mystery pervaded my daily tasks at work.
The mind of man's capacity knows no boundaries; if one pursues with focus on intellectual exploration and understanding of others and society's impacts and transformations and personal achievements, the greatest achievements lie before them; no bounds will exist to human mental power if this focus is harnessed for study and insight.

A man鈥檚 greatest success is never to fall in line.
Leadership development begins, in most organizations, in hindsight and often fails for those reasons, in visionary terms, one rarely observes strategies and trends emerging in advance but recognizes the moment they crystallize; in a pragmatic world, few predict market success yet countless projects have achieved nothing in this space and only by retrospect; for all of their practical benefits, such approaches remain lacking; in a corporate realm where efficiency prevails, not vision and growth are considered to be indisputable advantages but instead lag far behind in real progress, with those traits as well as any innovative potential left by the wayside, their strategic vision for leadership is no more effective nor pragmatic in actual business, a leader in an executive team that only thinks pragmatically would likely fall short in long-term corporate goals.

One doesn't fully embrace art till you can truly say I see all of you; and it wasn't art, my muse sighed, but rather art's creation of art... it wasn't beauty; for then the viewer had not only consumed an artwork but produced their very soul; their soul being that canvas that a brush never tasted till their brush created art within and through.

William Shakespeare, an extraordinary literary giant and undoubtedly one of the greatest ever English dramatists and poets ever written in world history.
A key difference between Renaissance theatre and Modern times can be seen in the approach towards adaptation, particularly as Shakespeare found ways to update his original stories into something that were more suited for the audience, with characters, story elements, motifs, themes and metaphors that remained but also evolved, changed and/or omitted according to each time's tastes, ideas, mores, conventions, norms and conventions of acting styles and presentation styles.
In his time Shakespeare had two moods, 'I like this place', or, 'Wear this ring' ... The difference between them can't even be stated and you might miss both at the first blush if the winds aren't too bad that morning ... 'To sleep perchance to dream.' He has an easy manner in everything, a good head upon his shoulders.
In Shakespeare, you enter a vast realm beyond any realist play.
William Shakespeare (April 23, 1564 - April 23, 1616) was a highly prolific English poet and playwright whose career spanned the early years of the English Renaissance.
Shakespeare's writing style was known for his skillful portrayal of character development and intricate plot constructions, showcasing his genius with both character analysis, plot intricacy, dialogue and stage setting in an age that didn't rely on dialogue.
Shakespeare's writing is one of the crowning glories of English letters.
Shakespeare combined both lyrical fluency in verse with emotional immediacy of the most universal and personal dimensions in the spoken prose or drama that he chose for performance in theatre, with both the dramatic situations as characters he gave expression, or both as it may, or with it and his actors鈥?presentation to their respective and varying and to both his characters' emotions or feelings that he expressed through speech in these cases.
It is the eye of childhood that looks in dreamland: childhood and sleep and youth find one.
In William Shakespeare's works, his skill with the written word can best be experienced and understood.
Shakespeare's works display unsurpassed variety, complexity, beauty, humanity, and power.
Shakespeare, arguably the most significant figure of Elizabethan theater, has inspired numerous directors over centuries to explore different perspectives when performing and presenting his work, demonstrating how much this artform remains open to re-evaluation, experimentation, and discovery, as we continually rediscover, understand, interpret, adapt, reinvent, question, analyze, or appreciate what was previously perceived and how the human imagination shapes what is seen from stage.
William Shakespeare was considered to have been born around 1564.
Every age and dress and trade has had his Shake speare and his Shakespeare-man - Shakespeare has passed like the measles.
Shakespeare's writings often utilize figurative speech that requires significant effort for analysis and appreciation, often with double or more interpretations and a wealth of nuance, such as: The more thou pours thy goodly eye The less'lt grace, than a fat kitchen.
Shakespeare was considered to have introduced an experimental new type of play with this comedy.
It's not just a question of understanding the poetry; one needs a feel for Shakespeare, so much of which was inevitably bound up in its context of theatre.
Shakespeare was the ultimate poet, writing sonnets as if every phrase had the music quality of song lyrics and yet incorporating narrative devices such as a heroic tale.
In the first scene of A Midsummer Night's Dream (1595-1596), William Shakespeare describes a wedding.
Whether one finds themselves agreeing or dissenting from William Shakespeare is, it may safely be assumed, immaterial; disagreeing, you would surely feel obliged to make it plain to him what it was he wrote; approving, your thoughts are no doubt whirled backward by that mighty imagination.
It was Bill鈥檚 special knack in introducing subjects or individuals: if it took his interest it never tired his enthusiasm; you knew everything worth telling or everybody, if anybody, in town that could amuse Bill: but Bill could introduce nobody: his conversation with himself and other things always bore his own name in capitals at once as inextricably mixed as that other subject.
The play I am about to tell You hath three plots and no end yet: a maiden's story of discontent with marriage; the man that killed this king - for I must call him that to the plot; this boy; - he killed a child of four, in passion's fit of fear - this was no deed at first sight.
Introduction Shakespeare鈥檚 language was marked by many elements.
There鈥檚 little comfort like an honest tale to be found on any shelf; so Shakespeare often tells it.
William Shakespeare was, without doubt, the towering icon in English dramatic writing, though not perhaps because he excelled so vastly in play writing itself, as some may contend, for many a Shakespeare critic may not know who he or she thinks of him.
During this 22 year time frame of 30, or almost all of his plays have premiered in Shakespearean history and continue to have the highest appeal of the Bard of Ayr.
To modern writers like us Shakespeare remains more legendary for the depth of influence than he was admired as an actual artist in the Elizabethan Age where he thrived with plays such as Richard II and King John; or The Comedy of Errors.
William Shakespeare has always fascinated critics, writers, readers, and directors with the unconventional beauty and intricate depths that exist only within the pages and stagecraft of his works.
It's hard to know exactly where Shakespeares playwright voice began in history; we don't even have all his original plays on one device, the most recent addition, Pericles and his coerced text for Timon, not all being accessible yet; even then there were plays where it wasn't always Shakespeare but an adaptor and play-wrought with an idea to reinterpret Shakespeare and it's hard sometimes with that one and only copy or that one only version in an online form.
From his plays Shakespeare鈥檚 poetry has found particular enduring quality as, though written over four centuries ago, they speak eloquently of life to audiences in our age as it does of Shakespeare's to readers and performers from four hundred years past, they are works where poetry has had, by dint of his inimitable gifts as an architect, its setting most enduring, where its buildings endure through eternity; so also are these, works, by his singular skills of design as playwright and craftsman of his words.
One notable difference in Shakespeare鈥檚 plays when considered as adaptations can be his focus.
Bard of Avon.
Shakespeare's style can be as opulently lavish (for the Earl of Southampton), or as terse and simple (in Romeo & Juliet's death-declaration poetry) or dramatically charged with language.
Every actor has heard this at least once, whether as an audience member or part of a show.
To those of you learning the art of writing: William Shakespeare was perhaps as well educated as any who ever attended schools; his formal training included learning to write.
Shakespeare's language in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' reflects his characteristic mix of realism and fanciful imagination, his ear for dialects, his wit, lyric poetry and powerful theatrical images, often using poetic prose, creating some of the immortal words of human language, the characters being at times, and the fairies are magical realist figures with realist details and often play with fantastic language.
With a penning that was swift, succinct, but still full-hearted in conveying deep feelings that went far below surface meanings, he seemed like he had taken from his personal emotions what the others took more cautiously, only when they needed some special help from his own emotional depth to achieve something beyond the everyday, like some extraordinarily profound artist who used every means he knew of expressing deep human truths with extraordinary skill, in which all words of a common usage appeared insipid.
In the Shakespeare era the popular viewpoint to entertaining people's thoughts were by engaging their imagination; in order to engage imagination effectively you have to provide imaginable context for thought-creating entertainment and for thought to flourish there is an immediate necessity to entertain, entertain with ideas.
Suffice it, if I say it to-morrow to his mistress and myself in's chamber ; then go thou softly, with thine ears blunt as the stag's; then leave, thou idola,' this house by break of day to him I follow and my wit to th' heart's ermine: then leave thy company; look for a master.
Shakespeare's writing style encompasses several techniques: a focus on natural human speech and colloquial vocabulary; character development; poetic metaphors and allusions to Classical, Greek and Roman sources, often reframed and retold for contemporary themes and events.
Shakespeare, a key influence for dramatists in every subsequent age and, of all authors in world literature, is unparalleled for both range and richness.
The beauty and elegance of Shakespearean verse cannot be surpassed by modern prose, making the poet the supreme ruler of literary masterpieces, and anyone seeking an enlightening understanding of poetry would benefit greatly from the lessons provided in the sonnets and tragedies, in their timeless beauty of the bard鈥檚 eloquence, revealing to any lover of the words their inherent truth, resonating for a hundred times in a lifetime and beyond.
Every great mind can think more precisely, clearly, more concisely than other people, for this great power in one single thing.
William Shakespeare has influenced modern English and modern artistic traditions by using techniques of linguistic variety in both comedies and tragedies that range from lyrical poetic expression, soliloquy to a rich diversity of rhythmical styles that were never duplicated and can't even really be appreciated except when listening in his works' context, or through analysis by critics or readers familiar with those.
